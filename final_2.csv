"Sultans of Deccan India, 1500–1700","['Navina Najat Haidar', 'Marika Sardar']","The vast Deccan plateau of south-central India stretches from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the region was home to several major Muslim kingdoms and became a nexus of international trade — most notably in diamonds and textiles, through which the sultanates attained remarkable wealth. The opulent art of the Deccan courts, invigorated by cultural connections to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, developed an otherworldly character distinct from that of the contemporary Mughal north: in painting, a poetic lyricism and audacious use of color; in the decorative arts, lively creations of inlaid metalware and painted and dyed textiles; and in architecture, a somber grandeur still visible today in breathtaking monuments throughout the plateau. The first book to fully explore the history and legacy of these kingdoms, Sultans of Deccan India elucidates the predominant themes in Deccani art—the region’s diverse spiritual traditions, its exchanges with the outside world, and the powerful styles of expression that evolved under court patronage—with fresh insights and new scholarship. Alongside the discussion of the art, lively, engaging essays by some of the field’s leading scholars offer perspectives on the cycles of victory and conquest as dynasties competed with one another, vied with Vijayanagara, a great empire to the south, and finally succumbed to the Mughals from the north. Featuring some 200 of the finest works from the Deccan sultanates, as well as spectacular site photographs and informative maps, this magnificently illustrated catalogue provides the most comprehensive examination of this world to date and constitutes a pioneering resource for specialists and general readers alike.",386.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oi4nBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oi4nBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=13&source=gbs_api,Opulence and Fantasy,No link available
"Critique of Fantasy, Vol. 1",['Laurence A. Rickels'],"Critique of Fantasy, Vol. 1: Between a Crypt and a Date Mark addresses both the style or genre of fantasy and the mental faculty, long the hot property of philosophical ethics. Freud passed it along in his 1907 essay on the poetics of daydreaming when he addressed omnipotent wish fantasy as the source and resource of the aspirations and resolutions of art, which, however, the artwork can never look back at or acknowledge. By grounding his genre in the one fantasy that is true, the Gospel, J.R.R. Tolkien obviated and made obvious the ethical mandate of fantasy's restraining order.With George Lucas's Star Wars we entered the borderlands of the fantasy and science fiction genres, a zone resulting from and staggering a contest, which Tolkien inaugurated in the 1930s. The history of this contested borderland marks changes that arose in expectation of what the new media held in store, changes realized (but outside the box of what had been projected) upon the arrival of the unanticipated digital relation, which at last seemed to award the fantasy genre the contest prize.Freud's notion of the Zeitmarke (datemark), the indelible impress of the present moment that triggered the daydream that denies it, already introduced the import of fantasy's historicization. Science fiction won a second prize that keeps it in the running. No longer bound to projecting the future, the former calling which in light of digitization it flunked, science fiction becomes allegorical and reading in the ruins of its failed predictions illuminates all the date marks and crypts hiding out in the borderlands it traverses with fantasy. To motivate the import of an evolving science fiction genre, Critique of Fantasy makes Gotthard Günther's reflections in the 1950s on American science fiction - as heralding a new metaphysics and a new planetary going on interstellar civilization - a mainstay of its cultural anthropology with B-genres.===After thirty years teaching at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2011 Laurence A. Rickels accepted a professorship in art and theory at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Karlsruhe and taught there as successor to Klaus Theweleit until 2017. During 2018 Rickels was Eberhard Berent Visiting Professor and Distinguished Writer at New York University, and he continues to offer seminars in media and philosophy at the European Graduate School (Saas Fee, Switzerland and Malta) where he holds the Sigmund Freud Chair. Rickels is the author of Aberrations of Mourning (Minnesota, 1988), The Case of California (Minnesota, 1991), The Vampire Lectures (Minnesota, 1999), Nazi Psychoanalysis (Minnesota, 2002), The Devil Notebooks (Minnesota, 2008), Ulrike Ottinger: The Autobiography of Art Cinema (Minnesota, 2008), I Think I Am: Philip K.

"Critique of Fantasy, Vol. 2",['Laurence A. Rickels'],"In the ""Introduction; or, How Star Wars Became Our Oldest Cultural Memory"" of the first volume of Critique of Fantasy, the gambit of a contest between science fiction and fantasy was already sketched out. J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis aimed to separate the fantasy from the techno-science foregrounded in works by H.G. Wells, for example, and raise the fantasy or fairy-story to the power of an alternate adult literary genre. My study of the contest between the B-genres for ownership of the evolution of the social relation of art out of the condemned site of day dreaming required in the first place a reading apparatus, which the first volume derived from psychoanalytic theories of daydreaming's relationship to conscious thought, the unconscious, and artistic production as well as from their prehistory, the philosophies of dreams, ghosts, willing and wishing.",235.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4gWVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA119&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=16&source=gbs_api,The Contest Between B-Genres,No link available

Material Fantasies,['Milena Veenis'],"""This study of East German fantasies of material abundance across the border, both before and after the fall of communism, shows the close and intricate relation between ideology and fantasy in upholding social life. In 1989, news broadcasts all over the world were dominated for weeks by images of East Germans crossing the Berlin Wall to West Germany. The images, representing the fall of communism and the democratic will of the people, also showed East Germans' excitement at finally being able to enter the western consumer paradise. But what exactly had they expected to find on the other side of the Wall? Why did they shed tears of joy when for the first time in their lives, they stepped inside West German shops? And why were they prepared to pay more than 10 percent of their average monthly wage for a pineapple? Drawing on fifteen months of research in the fast-changing post-communist East Germany, Veenis unravels the perennial truths about the interrelationships of fantasies of material wealth, personal fulfillment and social cohesion. She argues persuasively that the far-fetched socialist and capitalist promises of consumption as the road to ultimate well-being, the partial realization and partial corruption thereof, the implicit social and psychological interests underlying the politicized promises in both countries form the breeding ground for the development of materialist, cargo-cult-like fantasies, in which material well-being came to be seen as the place of ""fulfillment and ultimate arrival"".""--Publisher's website.",282.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ySXf2AvR98C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0ySXf2AvR98C&pg=PA29&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=22&source=gbs_api,Expectations of the Western Consumer World Among the East Germans,No link available
PHILOSOPHY OF LOVE,['Adrian G Dumitru'],"His love Her fantasy ... understanding what love is about As a man, but also as a woman, we try to define the undefined from a love story. Dreaming about love and being in love ... the path from the fantasy to the love story itself ... is just a matter of luck ... or maybe where you find yourself, on the timeline of your own life. Maybe is the perfect time for you to explore what love is about, or maybe other things are important at the moment ... and the love story can only be a future “project”. Exploring what love is about ... in our minds, as a fantasy ... or in the real life, as a real love story ... is depending only and only if we are ready or not. But what is the difference between fantasy and reality, when even the Bible is saying that everything we see is just an illusion? Well ... i believe that the fantasy is only the begining of defining what we want ... and the love story is the “experiment” itself. Is it too much to name a love story ... an “experiment”?! Well ... exploring ... as a fantasy or as reality is letting your soul understand what love is about. And ... sometimes is even a life lesson. The moment when you jump into the fairy tale ... the real fantasy ... and you understand the meaning of love ... the fact that love is about giving and not about receiving ... that is the moment when you also understand what life is about. Accepting your partner, just as he / she is ... just as accepting all the people from our lives is the moment of awakening. And also you should know that this path is leading you to point when your thinking will be totally redefined. Life itself ... is about love. Seeing what love is about ... is understanding the meaning of life. If the “love chapter” started for you ... even if it’s just a fantasy or reality ... you should be happy.

Magic Unbound,['Jill Nojack'],"Not-quite-sixteen year old Lizbet Moore expects a boring last month of summer vacation--and she gets what she’s expecting until a fifteen hundred year old Fae named Eamon shows up in her backyard disguised as a down-on-his-luck garden gnome. When Eamon slips an ancient amulet around her neck, the memories of Lizbet’s many past lives, including her first life as Morgan Le Fae, come slamming back to her to change her summer plans in a way she could never have expected. Forced to go on the run when murderous monks show up at the back door, Lizbet hops a plane to Scotland accompanied by Eamon, the whispering voices of her past lives, and geekily cute James, the college boy from next door. Not only does she have to dodge the monks, but she’s racing against time and greedy land developers to prevent the entire race of the Fae from being destroyed. The only thing Lizbet knows for sure is that if she fails and can't produce a few live fairies at the end of her journey, she is going to be grounded for life...and probably for her next life, too.

Uncharted,"['Kevin J. Anderson', 'Sarah A. Hoyt']","New Alternate History Fantasy series created by New York Times best-selling author Kevin J. Anderson and Sarah A. Hoyt. Arcane America A new world. New magic. New history. After Halley’s Comet was destroyed in a magical battle in 1759, the backlash separated the entire New World from the Old in an event known as The Sundering. Now isolated from the rest of the globe, America has become a very different place, where magic works and history has been changed forever. It is 1803—a new 1803. Young Meriwether Lewis, footloose and intrigued, goes to hear a lecture in St. Louis by the venerated old wizard Benjamin Franklin. Franklin’s talk is disrupted by the attack of a winged fire-breathing beast, much like legends from Lewis’s own Welsh heritage. In the aftermath, Franklin tells the young man that he knows of a great, growing evil that lurks in the uncharted Arcane Territories west of the Mississippi. Using his own vast fortune, Franklin commissions Lewis and his own talented partner William Clark to embark on a remarkable voyage of exploration, to meet and document the indigenous tribes, to find a route all the way to the Pacific Ocean—and perhaps beyond the magical veil to Europe again—and to stop the growing evil that is filling the American West. For while the Sundering separated the rest of the world and granted the original colonists unexpected magical gifts, sorcery inspired by native legends has also been ignited. And the Arcane Territories may hold unparalleled dangers for the expedition, both natural and magical. Accompanied by the brilliant shape-shifting sorceress Sacajawea, Lewis and Clark set off on an unparalleled adventure across a landscape that no European has ever seen.

The Perceptionalist,['Edward John Hamilton'],"""The general system of doctrine in the service of which both ""The Human Mind"" and ""Mental Science"" have been composed, might be styled Perceptionalism. For some such term may properly designate a form of philosophy which maintains, from an analytical and theoretical point of view, that mankind are not deluded in claiming that they perceive fact and truth, and that what they call their perceptions are true perceptions of those very things which they say that they perceive. The word ""perception"" is sometimes limited in its application: we now use it in its most unrestricted meaning. For we have perceptions of simple fact and perceptions of necessary relations; presentational perceptions and inferential perceptions; the perceptions of sense and of consciousness, and perceptions concomitant of these; the perceptions of the intuitive, and those of the discursive, reason: we perceive what is true actualistically and what is true hypothetically; we perceive the possible and the necessary, and the contingent and the probable. Our doctrine is that all these perceptions, when made by a sound mind and under proper conditions, are trustworthy; and our philosophy finds justification for this doctrine in the critical investigation of every mode of human cognition or conviction. Perceptionalism does not assert that the mind of man is infallible. On the contrary, recognizing the frequent recurrence of error, it seeks to understand the sources and laws of mistaken belief as well as those of correct belief. But it emphasizes the truth that man is capable of knowledge, or well-grounded certainty, about many things; and that where this is not attainable, he may often wisely form a judgment of probability""--Preface.

Cobweb Bride,['Vera Nazarian'],"Many are called... She alone can save the world and become Death's bride. COBWEB BRIDE (Cobweb Bride Trilogy, Book One) is a history-flavored fantasy novel with romantic elements of the Persephone myth, about Death's ultimatum to the world. What if you killed someone and then fell in love with them? In an alternate Renaissance world, somewhere in an imaginary ""pocket"" of Europe called the Kingdom of Lethe, Death comes, in the form of a grim Spaniard, to claim his Bride. Until she is found, in a single time-stopping moment all dying stops. There is no relief for the mortally wounded and the terminally ill.... Covered in white cobwebs of a thousand snow spiders she lies in the darkness... Her skin is cold as snow... Her eyes frozen... Her gaze, fiercely alive... While kings and emperors send expeditions to search for a suitable Bride for Death, armies of the undead wage an endless war... A black knight roams the forest at the command of his undead father... Spies and political treacheries abound at the imperial Silver Court.... Murdered lovers find themselves locked in the realm of the living... Look closer--through the cobweb filaments of her hair and along each strand shine stars... And one small village girl, Percy--an unwanted, ungainly middle daughter--is faced with the responsibility of granting her dying grandmother the desperate release she needs. As a result, Percy joins the crowds of other young women of the land in a desperate quest to Death's own mysterious holding in the deepest forests of the North... And everyone is trying to stop her.

Another Stupid Spell,['Bill Ricardi'],"Another Stupid Spell is a first person high fantasy novel, the likes of which hasn't been seen in 60 years. The tone and vocabulary of the story shifts as our narrator, Sorch the orc, finds ways to enhance his intelligence. You get to grow as Sorch grows, learn as he learns, and share his most intimate thoughts. Sorch is an orc mage in a world where orcs are cursed with stupidity every time they cast a spell. The only spell he can safely cast is Enhance Intelligence, which boosts his IQ for a fraction of a second before the curse drains it all away again. Normally casting such a spell would be pointless, but Sorch's tribe has found a way to benefit. Magic that is cast near a mysterious artefact called the ‘Voodoo Engine’ causes invisible hands to appear, and these hands get work done for his tribe. Sorch is a slave to the Voodoo Engine, casting a single spell over and over again to avoid being beaten by the chief’s warrior caste. While foraging for food on one fateful night, our hero happens upon two human mages who are in big trouble. He saves their lives, and in return they give him an amulet that will make his life easier. Unbeknownst to the humans, their gift grants Sorch the power to break the cycle of intelligence drain and physical abuse. With the help of his friend and mentor, Shaman, Sorch becomes a real mage. Sorch leaves his swamp and embarks on a series of incredibly exciting and dangerous adventures. During his travels he encounters horrible injury, magical treasures, love, snow, university admissions tests, a plot against the Kingdom, and then of course he saves the world. Or does he? Be prepared to rethink everything you know about thinking.

A History of Ottoman Poetry,['Elias John Wilkinson Gibb'],"Elias John Wilkinson Gibb (1857-1901) was a Scottish Orientalist who was born and educated in Glasgow. After studying Arabic and Persian, he developed an interest in Turkish language and literature, especially poetry, and in 1882 he published Ottoman Poems Translated into English Verse in the Original Forms. This was a forerunner to the six-volume classic presented here, A History of Ottoman Poetry, published in London between 1900 and 1909. Gibb died in London of scarlet fever at the age of 44, and only the first volume of his masterpiece appeared before his death. His family entrusted to his friend Edward Granville Browne (1862-1926), a distinguished Orientalist in his own right who had made a special study of Babism, the task of posthumously publishing the five remaining volumes. Browne characterized the work as ""one of the most important, if not the most important, critical studies of any Muhammadan literature produced in Europe during the last half-century."" The first volume contains a long and compelling introduction by Gibb on the entire subject, in which he argues that Ottoman poetry often rose and fell in tandem with Ottoman power. Gibb divides Ottoman poetry into two great schools, the Old or Asiatic (circa 1300-1859), which generally was characterized by its deference to Persian influences; and the New or European (from 1859 onward), which was influenced by French and other Western poetry. According to Gibb, the Old or Asiatic School went through a four periods: a formative period (1300-1450); a period (1450-1600) in which works were modeled after the Persian poet Jami; a period (1600-1700) dominated by the influences of Persian poets Urfi Shirazi and Saʼib Tabrizi; and a period of uncertainty that lasted until 1859. The European school that followed was inaugurated by Ibrahim Sinasi (1826-71), who in 1859 produced a small but momentous collection of French poetry translated into Turkish verse. The influence of the collection was far-reaching and eventually changed the course of Ottoman poetry. Gibb is known for his masterful translations that brilliantly render into English both the meaning and the form of Ottoman, Persian, and Arabic poetry. For almost a century after his death, a family trust financed the Gibb Memorial Series of editions and translations into English of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish texts.",488.0,['Turkish poetry'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T4IUAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=T4IUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=146&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T4IUAAAAIAAJ&rdid=book-T4IUAAAAIAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Delver Magic Book I: Sanctum's Breach,['Jeff Inlo'],"A rolling tremor passes through the land of Uton signaling a return of long absent magic as well as an ancient evil that accompanies it. Ryson Acumen, purebred delver, senses the changes and begins his explorations to discover the source behind the upheaval. In his investigations, he learns that legends he considered fables hold more truth than fantasy. The delver encounters elves and learns the Sphere of Ingar, a talisman that captured all magical energies long ago, is free from its tomb in Sanctum Mountain. As violent, evil creatures return to shred the very fabric of reality, the sphere gains awareness and chooses to spew corrupted magical energies to obliterate all life. The sphere must be destroyed, but it rests within Sanctum, a hollow mountain with a single path to its center. The way to the sphere remains defended by devices created long ago, forged by members of each race to thwart entry to the mountain's core. Those that wish to defeat the sphere must not only overcome these barriers, they must conquer the mistrust which has flourished during the long period of separation. Human, elf, dwarf, algor and delver must reunite to defeat the obstacles that now protect the sphere. Once inside Sanctum, representatives of each race face the secrets of the ages that once undone will change their lives forever.",,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KP1WAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KP1WAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=223&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KP1WAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KP1WAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Understanding and Investigating Child Sexual Exploitation,Unknown,"This guide indicates the sexual victimization of children is perpetrated by family members, acquaintances, and strangers; encompasses pornography, sex rings, and prostitution; and primarily involves preferential sex offenders who victimize children by operating child sex and pornography rings. Preferential sex offenders tend to be predatory serial offenders and can usually be identified by long-term and persistent behavior patterns, specific sexual interests, and fantasy-driven behavior. They often suffer from paraphilias, psychosexual disorders that involve recurrent, intense, and sexually arousing fantasies and from sexual urges and behaviors that usually involve nonhuman objects, the humiliation of oneself or one's partner, and children or other nonconsenting persons. In child sex ring and pornography cases, offenders typically control their victims by seducing them with attention, affection, kindness, and gifts until they have lowered the victim's inhibitions and gained his or her cooperation and consent. Because of their bond with the offender, victims frequently resent law enforcement intervention and may even warn the offender. The investigation of child sexual exploitation cases involving multiple victims molested by preferential offenders is usually complex and difficult. Guidelines are presented for interviewing victims and offenders, investigating offenders, recovering child exploitation evidence, obtaining expert search warrants, and conducting an effective prosecution. Special procedures to follow when investigating child sexual exploitation cases involving computers are noted, and types of offenders who engage in child pornography using computers are identified. An investigator's checklist for interviewing victims of preferential sex offenders is included. 6 references.",28.0,['Child abuse'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RzS4PalFulcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RzS4PalFulcC&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=224&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RzS4PalFulcC&rdid=book-RzS4PalFulcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Thyra,['Robert Ames Bennet'],"Review by Darius M. Klein: ""A Classic of the Genre"" is how Jessica Salmonsen has described this work. Robert Ames Bennet was primarily a writer of Westerns, but also wrote two Lost Race romances, one of which is ""Thyra: A Romance of the Polar Pit."" The plot concerns a group of explorers who fly in a balloon to the North Pole, where they discover, via an opening, that the earth is indeed hollow. Once inside the earth they encounter Viking and Neanderthal communities, along with survivals of Mesozoic megafauna. ""Thyra"" manages to intertwine the Utopian Lost Race and Lost World subgenres into a single, action-packed plot which never meanders or digresses. The first Viking community upon which the heroes stumble after they enter the bowels of the Earth (and where they find the eponymous heroine) is an unlikely Christian-Socialist Utopia. As they penetrate further into the Earth's interior, they encounter those Vikings who have given themselves over to idolatry and human sacrifice, along with a community of stereotypically aggressive and bestial Neanderthals. At the novel's climax, they have a perilous close encounter with some demonic prehistoric reptiles in the Hela Pool (a particularly well-written scene). The copy of this work which I obtained is a photocopy of the microfilm of the original 1901 edition, which has delightfully quaint illustrations; I don't know if they have been reproduced in the ""Lost Race and Adult Fantasy Fiction"" series' edition. Mr. Bennet's other Lost Race Romance, ""The Bowl of Baal,"" also combines Lost Race and Lost World motifs, and is recommended here. Of the two, however, ""Thyra"" is the better.",258.0,"['Fantasy fiction, American']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y306AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y306AQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=236&source=gbs_api,A Romance of the Polar Pit,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y306AQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-Y306AQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Ruling Passion,['Christopher Lane'],"In The Ruling Passion, Christopher Lane examines the relationship between masculinity, homosexual desire, and empire in British colonialist and imperialist fictions at the turn of the twentieth century. Questioning the popular assumption that Britain's empire functioned with symbolic efficiency on sublimated desire, this book presents a counterhistory of the empire's many layers of conflict and ambivalence. Through attentive readings of sexual and political allegory in the work of Kipling, Forster, James, Beerbohm, Firbank, and others--and deft use of psychoanalytic theory--The Ruling Passion interprets turbulent scenes of masculine identification and pleasure, power and mastery, intimacy and antagonism. By foregrounding the shattering effects of male homosexuality and interracial desire, and by insisting on the centrality of unconscious fantasy and the death drive, The Ruling Passion examines the startling recurrence of colonial failure in narratives of symbolic doubt and ontological crisis. Lane argues compellingly that Britain can progress culturally and politically only when it has relinquished its residual fantasies of global mastery.",352.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKxcAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bKxcAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=253&source=gbs_api,British Colonial Allegory and the Paradox of Homosexual Desire,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bKxcAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-bKxcAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Ong's Hat: The Beginning,['Joseph Matheny'],"“…a bizarre Internet phenomenon: an “immersive” online experience—part mystery, part game, part who knows what—known as both the Incunabula Papers and Ong’s Hat. The Incunabula Papers/Ong’s Hat was, or is, a “many-threaded, open-ended interactive narrative” that ”weds an alternate history of chaos science and consciousness studies to conspiracy theories, parallel dimensions, and claims that computer-mediated environments can serve as magical tools…. the documents provoked a widespread “immersive legend-trip” in the late 1990s. Via Web forums, participants investigated the documents—manifestos—which spun up descriptions of brilliant but suppressed discoveries relating to paths that certain scientists had forged into alternate realities. Soon, those haunted dimensions existed in the minds and fantasies of Ong’s Hat’s many participants. That was evident as they responded to the original postings by uploading their own—all manner of reflections and artifacts: personal anecdotes, audio recordings, and videos—to augment what became “a really immersive world, and it was vast”.",114.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BdE7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BdE7EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=286&source=gbs_api,Authorized Version,No link available

The Ghost,['Arnold Bennett'],"I am eight years older now. It had never occurred to me that I am advancing in life and experience until, in setting myself to recall the various details of the affair, I suddenly remembered my timid confusion before the haughty mien of the clerk at Keith Prowse's. I had asked him: ""Have you any amphitheatre seats for the Opera to-night?"" He did not reply. He merely put his lips together and waved his hand slowly from side to side. Not perceiving, in my simplicity, that he was thus expressing a sublime pity for the ignorance which my demand implied, I innocently proceeded: ""Nor balcony?"" This time he condescended to speak.

"Take Her, She's Yours",['Eva-Lynn Jagoe'],"We say, you belong to me, or I belong to you. But is it possible to be possessed by others? And can we ever possess ourselves? In this raw and intimate account, Eva-Lynn Jagoe merges memoir with critical theory as she recounts the unraveling of everything she thought she knew about selfhood, relationships, and desire. Through the story of an upbringing in a patriarchal Spanish and American household, a dissociative and painful relationship towards men and power, and a chaotic marriage and divorce, she interrogates the destructive fantasy of possessive individualism that permeates our psyches and our cultural expectations. Woven through this narrative is an account of the unique relationship that Jagoe has with her psychoanalyst, in which she works through her tendency to give herself away to others, and learns to navigate the many contradictory selves that we all hold within us. This journey leads her to an enriched understanding of self-possession. Jagoe's account of an examined life is inseparable from her commitment to the psychoanalytic, feminist, and queer theories that sustain and nourish her in her search for an expanded definition of self.Jagoe's unique blend of musings and reflections on literature, fairy tale, and culture; her willingness to delve into abjection and contradictory desires; and her honest portrayal of the realities of psychoanalysis allow for a timely exploration of gender, sex, and power. Take Her, She's Yours belongs in the company of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's A Dialogue on Love and the memoirs of Maggie Nelson, Rachel Cusk, and Lidia Yuknavitch. It engrossingly conveys the lived urgency of critical thinking and the pleasures and perils of embodied selfhood. Take Her, She's Yours is a story about loss and letting go, but also about the intimacy that emerges through an expanded definition of selfhood. Eva-Lynn Jagoe is the author of The End of the World as They Knew It: Writing Experiences of the Argentine South. Her essays, articles, and stories have appeared in Bluestem Literary Magazine, Discourse, Fables for the 21st Century, Guts Canadian Feminist Magazine, Public, and Writing From Below, as well as numerous academic journals. She is a professor at University of Toronto, where she teaches critical and cultural theory, environmental humanities, Latin American studies, film, and literature.

Fonthill Recovered,['Caroline Dakers'],"Fonthill, in Wiltshire, is traditionally associated with the writer and collector William Beckford who built his Gothic fantasy house called Fonthill Abbey at the end of the eighteenth century. The collapse of the Abbey’s tower in 1825 transformed the name Fonthill into a symbol for overarching ambition and folly, a sublime ruin. Fonthill is, however, much more than the story of one man’s excesses. Beckford’s Abbey is only one of several important houses to be built on the estate since the early sixteenth century, all of them eventually consumed by fire or deliberately demolished, and all of them oddly forgotten by historians. Little now remains: a tower, a stable block, a kitchen range, some dressed stone, an indentation in a field. Fonthill Recovered draws on histories of art and architecture, politics and economics to explore the rich cultural history of this famous Wiltshire estate. The first half of the book traces the occupation of Fonthill from the Bronze Age to the twenty-first century. Some of the owners surpassed Beckford in terms of their wealth, their collections, their political power and even, in one case, their sexual misdemeanours. They include Charles I’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the richest commoner in the nineteenth century. The second half of the book consists of essays on specific topics, filling out such crucial areas as the complex history of the designed landscape, the sources of the Beckfords’ wealth and their collections, and one essay that features the most recent appearance of the Abbey in a video game.",430.0,"['Authors, English']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AuJaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AuJaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=309&source=gbs_api,A Cultural History,No link available

The Politics and Poetics of Authenticity places authenticity at the heart of Sinhala nationalism in late nineteenth and twentieth-century Sri Lanka. It argues that the passion for the ‘real’ or the ‘authentic’ has played a significant role in shaping nationalist thinking and argues for an empathetic yet critical engagement with the idea of authenticity. Through a series of fine-grained and historically grounded analyses of the writings of individual figures central to the making of Sinhala nationalist ideology the book demonstrates authenticity’s rich and varied presence in Sri Lankan public life and its key role in understanding postcolonial nationalism in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in South Asia and the world. It also explores how notions of authenticity shape certain strands of postcolonial criticism and offers a way of questioning the taken-for-granted nature of the nation as a unit of analysis but at the same time critically explore the deep imprint of nations and nationalisms on people's lives.",176.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PaZjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PaZjDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=316&source=gbs_api,A Cultural Genealogy of Sinhala Nationalism,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PaZjDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PaZjDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Steel Orb,['C. J. S. Hayward'],"This anthology is one volume from C.J.S. Hayward's collected works. It includes an offbeat chain letter parody, a no less whimsical work (although more serious) in which a Church Father comments on a postmodern trend, a solemn farewell to a holiday, a look at all spirituality boiling down to two basic rules, a relatively long short story that looks at what, exactly, can be good about a life filled with pain, a paean of praise about the glory of the Creator reflected in the Creation, a dialogue exploring whether, exactly, time is what a watch measures, and then two closing, connected stories. One is a science fiction short story, and the other a fantasy novella, but they have much in common.",208.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nuLIJ7haDOgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nuLIJ7haDOgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=317&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Pretoria Student Law Review 2020-14-2,['Simon Motshweni'],"About the publication Honoured to present to you, the reader, the 2020 edition of the Pretoria Student Law Review (PSLR), an annual publication which is the pride of the best law faculty in Africa (according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings). The University of Pretoria’s Law Faculty ranks in the top 100 law faculties in the world, a feat unequalled in Africa. The PSLR is a student driven law review that creates an interactive forum for students, academics and legal professionals to discuss topical legal matters that challenge the status quo. At the beginning of this year, lay the fantasy of newness — presenting an opportunity to do great things. But as I reflect on the journey leading to this publication, I understand that the 2020 edition of the PSLR had an engine that ran on hope; faith; dedication; perseverance; commitment and hard work. Our predecessors had a vision to create a boldly outlined legacy for the PSLR, they spearheaded the setting up of a system that would last the lifespan of the PSLR. Today, some 13 years after the first edition of the PSLR, South Africa, the continent and the world at large are on the cusp of a new era — socially, economically and politically. When my journey as Editor-in-Chief commenced, I imagined the PSLR as a ship, whose captain was myself. Customarily, it is easy to be a captain of a ship in calm seas, but unlike most of my predecessors, I have had to be the captain of a ship through the heftiest of storms. The world was not truly prepared to face challenges presented by the Covid-19, let alone the PSLR. In the wake of the 4IR and this new age of technology, sailing this ship to success was still a heavy task to complete. It is therefore with great honour to have been able to successfully complete the task for which we, the 14th cohort of the Editorial Board, were called for. We have upheld the esteemed reputations that have been left by our predecessors. Fittingly, I wish to applaud my team for their inspiring commitment, outstanding contribution and service in maintaining the elevated standard of the PSLR. For indeed it is a publication, par excellence. Amidst the storms, we have spearheaded the establishment of a ‘free-floating’ PSLR Collection in the OR Tambo Law Library. This collection is dedicated to house all published PSLR editions, dating since the inception of the PSLR in 2007. We have established and strengthened relations with other Law Faculties in the country, and even beyond. We published the very first special edition of the PSLR, a focused edition that covers a critical issue brought before the South African Law Deans Association — the Decolonisation of Legal Education. We have established a system by which all authors who publish with us, ought to have an ORCID iD. We have adopted internal regulations that outline the principles that govern the Editorial Board. We have spearheaded the adoption and implementation of a policy that forces us to comply with DHET Standards in order to be a DHET Accredited Journal so as to encourage and foster a student culture of critical research & writing in legal academia. I am truly proud of the work that the authors have put into their articles and I would like to thank them for their submissions and tireless efforts to produce quality articles. More-so, I am proud of the Editorial Board for being able to work under immense pressure. This edition would have not been possible without the dedication and hard work of this dream team. I remain indebted to you all: Adelaide Chagopa, Kayla Thomas, Marcia van der Merwe, Nicholas Herd and Phenyo Sekati. It has been a great pleasure and a privilege to have worked with you on this annual edition. A note of thanks to Dr Gustav Muller in his capacity as the Guardian of the PSLR. To the reviewers, your adjudication lays the foundation for each edition, year-in-yearout. Your support and contribution to the PSLR remains invaluable. To Lizette Hermann, Elzet Hurter and Mornay Hassen, thank you for your continued and immeasurable support throughout this journey. To Primrose E.R Kurasha, thank you for believing in me and for guiding me. I am forever indebted to you my friend. To my family: Elizabeth Mtshweni; Jostina Mtshweni; Clayton Mtshweni; Lucas Berto Mateus; Stephine Mashilo and Lerato Mashilo, words cannot begin to express my gratitude for all the support you have given me throughout this journey. Thank you for keeping me sane through one of the toughest times of my ‘publishing’ career. Thank you for the endless amount of support and the unconditional love you give me always. You are the power & oil that kept this engine running, all by the sufficient grace of God. I hereby pass the baton and entrust the next Editor-in-Chief with the difficult task of running faster and running a better marathon than myself and my predecessors. To you future author, I implore you to start writing, for the water does not flow until the faucet is turned on. To you the reader, Jurgen Zwecker was right: enjoy the read — without fear to question what is in front of you, for that is the only way we, as scholars, grow.

New Mana,"['Matt Tomlinson', 'Ty P. K?wika Tengan']","‘Mana’, a term denoting spiritual power, is found in many Pacific Islands languages. In recent decades, the term has been taken up in New Age movements and online fantasy gaming. In this book, 16 contributors examine mana through ethnographic, linguistic, and historical lenses to understand its transformations in past and present. The authors consider a range of contexts including Indigenous sovereignty movements, Christian missions and Bible translations, the commodification of cultural heritage, and the dynamics of diaspora. Their investigations move across diverse island groups—Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Hawai‘i, and French Polynesia—and into Australia, North America and even cyberspace. A key insight that the volume develops is that mana can be analysed most productively by paying close attention to its ethical and aesthetic dimensions. Since the late nineteenth century, mana has been an object of intense scholarly interest. Writers in many fields including anthropology, linguistics, history, religion, philosophy, and missiology have long debated how the term should best be understood. The authors in this volume review mana’s complex intellectual history but also describe the remarkable transformations going on in the present day as scholars, activists, church leaders, artists, and entrepreneurs take up mana in new ways.",391.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GqBnDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GqBnDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=322&source=gbs_api,Transformations of a Classic Concept in Pacific Languages and Cultures,No link available

Romance and the Erotics of Property,['Jan Cohn'],"Romance and the Erotics of Property examines contemporary popular romance from a number of different points of view, probing for codes and subtexts that sometimes exploit and sometimes contradict its surface tale of romantic attraction, frustration, longing, and fulfillment. Cohn argues that a full understanding of the contemporary romance requires an investigation of its literary and historical sources and analogues. Three principal sources are examined in the context of women's history in bourgeois society. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Erye, and Gone With the Wind demonstrate the development of romance fiction's themes, yet in all three the central love story is complicated by issues of property, the sign of male power. Jan Cohn further considers the development of the genre n the fictions of Harriet Lewis and May Agnes Fleming, prolific and popular American romance writers of the late nineteenth century who developed the role of the villain, thereby bringing into focus the sexual and economic struggles faced by the heroine. Romance and the Erotics of Property sets romance fiction against a historic and literary background, arguing that contemporary romance disguises as tales of love the subversive fantasies of female appropriation and male property and power.",200.0,['American fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZOtZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZOtZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=327&source=gbs_api,Mass-market Fiction for Women,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZOtZAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-ZOtZAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Still, even fledgling angels must prove themselves to earn a place in Seraph training with the revered Archangels. And so far, Nimbus is an unmitigated disaster: his arrows go awry, he's addicted to human food and the Nymphs run if there's the vaguest hint he'll attempt a spell. When all the Gods and Archangels on the Ethereal Realm abruptly disappear, it's up to Celestial, their irresponsible Ambrosia-swilling tutor Bacchus, and Nimbus to put things right. With his confidence lower than an orc's backside and his skills even worse, how can one little fledgling angel hope to prevail against the vicious Fallen and their evil master Azazel?

The Fantastic Life of Walter Murray Gibson,"['Jacob Adler', 'Robert M. Kamins']","Walter Murray Gibson is one of the most enigmatic personalities in nineteenth-century Hawaiian history. Michener and Day saw him as an engaging rogue and included him in their Rascals in Paradise along with buccaneer Bully Hayes and Captain Bligh. Gavan Daws portrayed him in A Dream of Islands as a romantic and compassionate man who rashly challenged the ascendant planter-missionary party at a decisive period in Hawaii’s political history. Imbued since youth with grandiose ideals and soaring flights of fantasy, Gibson pursued throughout his life the dream of an island utopia flourishing under his leadership The East Indies beckoned first, and there on the island of Sumatra Gibson sought his fortune, finding instead a Dutch prison cell on Java. Recast as a Mormon, the High Priest of Melchizedek and chosen emissary of Brigham Young, Gibson gathered his flock about him on the island of Lanai, and was judged by the church to deserve excommunication. He finally realized his dream as Kipikona, Kalakaua’s “Minister of Everything,” the most skilled politician of his day, only to be driven from office and publicly taunted with a hangman’s noose. Authors Adler and Kamins bring historical reality to this turbulent and controversial life story. Carefully researched and engagingly written, The Fantastic Life of Walter Murray Gibson shows the many sides of this man of myriad talents--adventurer, New York businessman, Washington lobbyist, scholar, newspaper editor, orator, rancher, consummate legislative leader, “Minister of Everything,” and, always, a dreamer who dared to reach for the sun.",269.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a1rGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a1rGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=345&source=gbs_api,Hawaii's Minister of Everything,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a1rGDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-a1rGDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Kyoka, Japan's Comic Verse",['Robin D.

Read together with The Woman Without a Hole, also by Robin D.

Return to the Caffe Cino,['Steve Susoyev'],"RETURN TO THE CAFFE CINO gives a fresh, exciting portrait of the non-commercial NY theater scene in the 1960's.

The Boogeyman (Myth),['Drac Von Stoller'],"Every night little Johnny would lie in his bed and read his favorite comic book series ""The Boogeyman."" Johnny’s big sister Betty would tease him about his comic book on a daily basis, and say things like, ""Johnny if you don't stop reading those stupid comic books the boogeyman is going to get you."" She would come in his room and yank the comic book out of his hands and throw it across the room. The more his sister tormented him, the more anger for his sister was mounting. Finally,one night as he was reading about the boogeyman his sister yanked the comic book out of his hands and started tearing the pages out of the comic book. She said as she was laughing ""Sorry, Johnny, but it's for your own good."" Johnny replied, ""I wish you were dead."" Betty said as she was laughing hysterically ""What are you going to do, sick the boogeyman on me?"" ""You wait and see,"" replied Johnny in an angry voice. Betty said ""Grow up you stupid little twerp,"" as she slammed the door behind her. Johnny got out of his bed and spent the remainder of the night taping the boogeyman comic book pages back together on his desk by the bedroom window as tears flowed down his cheeks. Johnny closed his eyes and said ""If there really is a boogeyman, come out of the closet. I want to show you to my sister so she’ll stop teasing me about your existence?"" A couple minutes later as Johnny was drifting in and out of sleep, a light was peering beneath the closet doors with a low lying fog pouring out beneath the closet doors. A voice called out to Johnny and said ""Johnny it's the boogeyman."" Johnny raised his head off his desk and jumped out of his chair and fell to the floor. The doors of the closet flung wide open and there stood a dark figure over six feet tall with blazing red eyes and a sinister voice calling out to Johnny.",3.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LovUozS_uaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LovUozS_uaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=360&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LovUozS_uaoC&rdid=book-LovUozS_uaoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Benign Flame – Saga of love,['BS Murthy'],"The attractions Roopa experienced and the fantasies she entertained as a teen shaped a male imagery that ensconced her subconscious. Insensibly, confident carriage came to be associated with the image of maleness in her mind-set. Her acute consciousness of masculinity only increased her vulnerability to it, making her womanliness crave for the maleness for its gratification. However, as her father was constrained to help her in becoming a doctor, she opts to marry, hoping that Sathyam might serve her cause though the persona she envisioned as masculine, she found lacking in him. But as he fails to go with her idea, she becomes apathetic towards him, and insensibly sinks into her friend Sandhya’s embrace, for lesbian solace. Soon, in a dramatic sequence of events, Tara, a suave call girl, tries to rope Roopa into her calling; Roopa herself loses her heart to Sandhya's beau Raja Rao, and Prasad, her husband’s friend falls for her. And as Prasad begins to induce Sathyam to be seduced by whores to worm his way into her affections, Roopa finds herself in a dilemma. However, as fate puts Raja Rao into Roopa’s arms in such a way as to lend novelty to fiction, this ‘novel’ nuances man-woman chemistry on one hand, and portrays woman-woman empathy on the other. Who said the novel is dead; 'Benign Flame' raises the bar as vouched by - The plot is quite effective and it’s a refreshing surprise to discover that the story will not trace a fall into disaster for Roopa, given that many writers might have habitually followed that course with a wife who strays into extramarital affairs - Spencer Critchley, Literary Critic, U.S.A. The author has convinced the readers that love is something far beyond the marriage tie and the fulfillment of love can be attained without marriage bondage. The author has achieved a minor revolution without any paraphernalia of revolution in the fourth part of the novel – The Quest, India. The author makes free use of – not interior monologue as such, but – interior dialogue of the character with the self, almost resembling the dramatic monologue of Browning. Roopa, Sandhya, Raja Rao and Prasad to a considerable extent and Tara and Sathyam to a limited degree indulge in rationalization, trying to analyse their drive sand impulses – The Journal of Indian Writing in English. Overall, Benign Flame is a unique attempt at exploring adult relationships and sexuality in the contemporary middle-class. All the characters come alive with their cravings and failings, their love and their lust. Benign Flame blurs the lines and emphasizes that life is not all black and white - it encompasses the full spectrum of living - Indian Book Chronicle.",223.0,['Antiques & Collectibles'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=thnWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=thnWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=384&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Theory of Colours,"['Johann Wolfgang von Goethe', 'Donald Eastlake']","By closely following Goethe's explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory—Goethe never even mentions it—that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern. By the time Goethe's Theory of Colours appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color. Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: “From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible.” Goethe's scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions. The book does not have to be studied to be appreciated. Goethe's subjective theory of colors permits him to speak most persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. In some readers these notions will evoke a positive response on their merits. Others may regard them as pure fantasy, but savor the grace and style of their exposition. The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe's conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects—vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like—the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color. By closely following Goethe's explanations of the color phenomena, the reader may become so divorced from the wavelength theory—Goethe never even mentions it—that he may begin to think about color theory relatively unhampered by prejudice, ancient or modern.",512.0,['Design'],3.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7uVMAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7uVMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=398&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7uVMAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-7uVMAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Mosses from an Old Manse,['Nathaniel Hawthorne'],"In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy, who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one. He had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant, cleared his fine countenance from the furnace smoke, washed the stain of acids from his fingers, and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife. In those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle, it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy. The higher intellect, the imagination, the spirit, and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which, as some of their ardent votaries believed, would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another, until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself.",594.0,['New England'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AxQ8AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AxQ8AQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=416&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AxQ8AQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-AxQ8AQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

I could tell it was just a matter of minutes when death would knock upon my door. Just as the carriage pulled up to the front of the castle's gate my heart was telling me not to answer the door. I knew in my heart when destiny knocks upon your door there's no stopping a good or evil presence. Then the black figure stepped down from the carriage slowly walking to the front door of the castle and with three loud knock's on the door, I calmly walked down the castle stairs to the front door shaking like a leaf to see who was at my front door.",9.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MY0FRcvi3-IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MY0FRcvi3-IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=421&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MY0FRcvi3-IC&rdid=book-MY0FRcvi3-IC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Figuring the Past,"['Belén Vidal', 'Belén Vidal Villasur']","""This definitive work offers a new approach to the period film at the turn of the twenty-first century, examining the ways in which contemporary cinema recreates the historical past. This book explores the relation between visual motifs and cultural representation in a range of key films by James Ivory, Martin Scorsese and Jane Campion, among others. Looking at the mannerist taste for citation, detail and stylisation, the author argues for an aesthetic of fragments and figures central to the period film as an international genre. Three key figures - the house, the tableau and the letter - structure a critical journey through a selection of detailed case studies, in relation to changing notions of visual style, melodrama, and gender. This seeks to place this popular but often undervalued genre in a new light and to rethink its significance in the context of key debates in film studies.""--Publisher's website.",257.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E5HOBSod4yAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=E5HOBSod4yAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=442&source=gbs_api,Period Film and the Mannerist Aesthetic,No link available

Constructing Virtue and Vice,['Olga V. Trokhimenko'],"The study examines textual representations of women's laughter and smiling and their imagined connection to female virtue in a wide variety of discourses and contexts of the German Middle Ages, including medieval epic, ecclesiastical texts, conduct literature, lyric, and sculpture. By engaging with the competing, and at times contradictory, views of female laughter, it reaffirms a disputatious nature of medieval culture, in which multiple views of femininity, sexuality, and virtue stood in a conflicting, yet productive, dialogue with one another. The society that emerges when one looks at medieval German texts is always ambivalent: it thrives on and enjoys talking about sensuality and eroticism, while being constrained by the conventions of polite behavior and the fear of sin; it relies on the ritual use of laughter, while marking it as a sign of lust and perdition. Women's laughter thus offers an important way into understanding medieval views of gender because it combines physicality with shifting and conflicting cultural norms.",255.0,['History'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Qu9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2Qu9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=455&source=gbs_api,Femininity and Laughter in Courtly Society (ca. 1150-1300),No link available

Molly`s father Jack decided it might be a good idea to call a priest to see if she was possessed. Jack got in touch with Father Ryan who`s church is about a mile from where they live. Jack`s voice was really shook up, he could barely get the words out because it was his daughter who he loved so dearly, and felt hopeless to save her from what was possessing her body. As Jack was discussing his daughters problem to Father Ryan over the phone he reassured Jack he has seen this kind of behavior before and would do everything in his power to rid his daughter from the evilness she was possessing inside her body. Father Ryan said ""Let me get my things together that I will need to perform an exorcism and I will be over shortly."" ""Thank you so much,"" replied Jack. Father Ryan knew time was at hand and there was no time to waste because the possession described by Jack over the phone would be enough to kill Jack's daughter before the night set in. He grabbed his bible, holy water and placed them in his bag, then got in his car and sped down the road to Jack's house ready to rid the girl of her evil demons. He pulled into Jack`s driveway and gathered his things and knocked on Jack`s front door. Jack opened the door and said ""Please hurry! She is speaking a different language and throwing up some green vomit and levitating off the bed.""",3.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=612TBfYqGPAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=612TBfYqGPAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=481&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=612TBfYqGPAC&rdid=book-612TBfYqGPAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Two fresh faces attempt to discern the complexities of love through the missing spousal equations between their parents. Set in the small town of Mardan in the North-West Frontier Province of British India in March 1947, this dark comedy deals with unpretentious stories of a mix-up between everyday folks, and a juvenile's account of vehemence in turbulent times, and his efforts to trace out histories for reflections. A safe escape to Kurukshetra in India on the posh train, 'The Frontier Mail' in a windy night amidst vicious rioting outside, presents him with a hallucinatory panorama of pre-settlements, and a teeny past of a few centuries that offers little solution to the predicament of a period that saw a million killed, and ten millions displaced in the wake of two independences.",15.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YcbPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YcbPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=544&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Buzzy-Wuzzy Busy Fly,['Oksana Ignaschenko'],"The collection contains sketches created by Oksana Ignashchenko in St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) in 1986 during the Chernobyl disaster.

The text content of the book is based on the Oksana Ignashchenko's memories of those times. The book is the main bestseller of the artist; back in the early 1990s, it was distributed by many millions of printed copies.

Ethics and Aesthetics of Translation,['Harriet Hulme'],"Ethics and Aesthetics of Translation engages with translation, in both theory and practice, as part of an interrogation of ethical as well as political thought in the work of three bilingual European authors: Bernardo Atxaga, Milan Kundera and Jorge Semprún. In approaching the work of these authors, the book draws upon the approaches to translation offered by Benjamin, Derrida, Ricœur and Deleuze to highlight a broad set of ethical questions, focused upon the limitations of the monolingual and the democratic possibilities of linguistic plurality; upon our innate desire to translate difference into similarity; and upon the ways in which translation responds to the challenges of individual and collective remembrance. Each chapter explores these interlingual but also intercultural, interrelational and interdisciplinary issues, mapping a journey of translation that begins in the impact of translation upon the work of each author, continues into moments of linguistic translation, untranslatability and mistranslation within their texts and ultimately becomes an exploration of social, political and affective (un)translatability. In these journeys, the creative and critical potential of translation emerges as a potent, often violent, but always illuminating, vision of the possibilities of differentiation and connection, generation and memory, in temporal, linguistic, cultural and political terms.",288.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g8h6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g8h6DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=548&source=gbs_api,"Exploring the Works of Atxaga, Kundera and Semprún",No link available
Castle Drac Von Stoller,['Drac Von Stoller'],"Off in a distance stood a dark desolate castle in north-western Ireland full of mystery and macabre known as Castle Drac Von Stoller. Anyone that would dare talk bad about the castle would later come up missing without a trace. Costume parties were held at the castle where ballroom dancing would also take place. Legend has it that Count Drac Von Stoller impaled the great Wizard Estavan and just as the Count was about to sink his teeth into the Wizard's neck the Wizard pulled his magic wand out of his cloak and a beam of light shot through the wand into the mirror standing in the corner. Estavan the Wizard said as he was gasping his last breathe on the impaling stake. ""Count for what you've done to me, I curse you to the mirror where you will remain for all eternity unless you can find thirteen virgin maiden's, impale them and suck every drop of their precious blood from their bodies. If you fail the mirror will be your final resting place, you only have one chance to lift the curse.” As Estavan's eyes were closing, a beam of light shown through the mirror and surrounded the Count. No matter how hard the Count tried to free himself the curse was too strong. Eventually the Count Drac Von Stoller gave in and the mirror pulled the Count inside never to be heard from again for over three-hundred years.",8.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=md7Ew_voE68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=md7Ew_voE68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=551&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=md7Ew_voE68C&rdid=book-md7Ew_voE68C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Once Upon a Fishbowl,['Aria Fafat'],"“Once Upon a Fishbowl” is an imaginative book - a parable, an allegory - which playfully captures a very human story, but one which is set in the marine world of fish. The story parallels the biography of Serena Williams, the tennis player, as it recounts the unfolding life of a blue fish named “Selena Gilliums” and her quest to be the ocean-wide fish-champion in the game of ""Bubble Ball"", a game fish play in water with their fins using oily air bubbles. And why ""blue” fish? Because the ocean of Aria's imagination has fish of 2 colors, blue and yellow. Just as humans consciously and subconsciously engage in discrimination based on skin color, the fish in this world discriminate based on fin colors - they engage in ""fishism"". The book skillfully traces the long struggle against fishism, fish slavery and the fight for Civil Rights in the fictional ocean country called ""The United Shoals of Americlam"" while weaving the athletic rise in contemporary times of Selena Gilliam. It celebrates the journey of tribulations, frustration and eventual triumph of a larger-than-whale spirit of Selena, who rises above all the obstacles to become the fish which was the GOAT - Greatest of All Time - in Bubble Ball... The book does not merely trace Serena's life or past history, though. It showcases many issues which are as relevant today as a hundred years ago - gender discrimination, religious discrimination, class discrimination, our fights against fellow humans based on stereotypes and nationality, our blatant plundering of environment, our pollution footprint... a very sobering reminder from a fish narrator... Even the book’s tagline, ""Are Fish Racist? Are they following human footsteps?"" is a haunting reminder to us all about our responsibility (and irresponsibility) toward nature and all which surrounds us. The book is replete with delightful puns, a very sophisticated use of English language and a large number of fish drawings sketched by the author and scattered throughout the book. There are also these cute explanatory notes for humans who may not know the inner workings of the marine world, and a comical glossary. This metaphorical biopic is a wonderful work of art and creativity from a very young, precocious author. It will inspire people of all ages to reflect on the importance of overcoming our prejudices, and rising above our superficial differences, to truly be “human”.",257.0,['Fiction'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ial6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ial6DwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=558&source=gbs_api,The Story of a Blue Fish,No link available

Film Remakes as Ritual and Disguise,['Anat Zanger'],"The first full-length history of the remake in cinema, Film Remakes as Ritual and Disguise is also the first book to explore how and why these stories are told. Anat Zanger focuses on contemporary retellings of three particular tales—Joan of Arc, Carmen, and Psycho—to reveal what she calls the remake’s “rituals of disguise.” Joan of Arc, Zanger demonstrates, later appears as the tough, androgynous Ripley in the blockbuster Alien series and the God-ridden Bess in Lars Von Trier’s Breaking the Waves. Ultimately, these remake chains offer evidence of the archetypes of our own age, cultural “fingerprints” that are reflective of society’s own preferences and politics. Underneath the redundancy of the remake, Zanger shows, lies our collective social memory. Indeed, at its core the lowly remake represents a primal attempt to gain immortality, to triumph over death—playing at movie theaters seven days a week, 365 days a year. Addressing the wider theoretical implications of her argument with sections on contemporary film issues such as trauma, jouissance, and censorship, Film Remakes as Ritual and Disguise is an insightful addition to current debates in film theory and cinema history.",172.0,['Performing Arts'],3.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eDm0NWZujrgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eDm0NWZujrgC&pg=PP1&dq=Fantasy&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=569&source=gbs_api,From Carmen to Ripley,No link available

The Incunabula Papers/Ong’s Hat was, or is, a “many-threaded, open-ended interactive narrative” that ”weds an alternate history of chaos science and consciousness studies to conspiracy theories, parallel dimensions, and claims that computer-mediated environments can serve as magical tools…. the documents provoked a widespread “immersive legend-trip” in the late 1990s. Via Web forums, participants investigated the documents—manifestos—which spun up descriptions of brilliant but suppressed discoveries relating to paths that certain scientists had forged into alternate realities. Soon, those haunted dimensions existed in the minds and fantasies of Ong’s Hat’s many participants.

Now the Count spends his lonely days inside his castle thinking of his beautiful wife Marie and stares at her portrait on the wall in the study, talking directly at the painting as though she can hear what he's saying. One night when the Count was reading a book on ghosts, he caught a glimpse of something in the corner of his eye that frightened the willies out of him. It was a black cat with blazing red eyes.

Biopunk Dystopias,['Lars Schmeink'],"'Biopunk Dystopias' contends that we find ourselves at a historical nexus, defined by the rise of biology as the driving force of scientific progress, a strongly grown mainstream attention given to genetic engineering in the wake of the Human Genome Project (1990-2003), the changing sociological view of a liquid modern society, and shifting discourses on the posthuman, including a critical posthumanism that decenters the privileged subject of humanism. The book argues that this historical nexus produces a specific cultural formation in the form of ""biopunk"", a subgenre evolved from the cyberpunk of the 1980s. Biopunk makes use of current posthumanist conceptions in order to criticize contemporary reality as already dystopian, warning that a future will only get worse, and that society needs to reverse its path, or else destroy all life on this planet.",280.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ez7jDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ez7jDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=6&source=gbs_api,"Genetic Engineering, Society, and Science Fiction",No link available
American Cities in Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction,['Robert Yeates'],"Visions of the American city in post-apocalyptic ruin permeate literary and popular fiction, across print, visual, audio and digital media. American Cities in Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction explores the prevalence of these representations in American culture, drawing from a wide range of primary and critical works from the early-twentieth century to today. Beginning with science fiction in literary magazines, before taking in radio dramas, film, video games and expansive transmedia franchises, Robert Yeates argues that post-apocalyptic representations of the American city are uniquely suited for explorations of contemporary urban issues. Examining how the post-apocalyptic American city has been repeatedly adapted and repurposed to new and developing media over the last century, this book reveals that the content and form of such texts work together to create vivid and immersive fictional spaces in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Chapters present media-specific analyses of these texts, situating them within their historical contexts and the broader history of representations of urban ruins in American fiction. Original in its scope and cross-media approach, American Cities in Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction both illuminates little-studied texts and provides provocative new readings of familiar works such as Blade Runner and The Walking Dead, placing them within the larger historical context of imaginings of the American city in ruins.",212.0,['Social Science'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W4NOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=W4NOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W4NOEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-W4NOEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Sci-Fi Film Fiesta,['Chris Christopoulos'],"This volume is part of a series intended as a salute to the pioneering work of science fiction film makers from the ‘golden age’ of science fiction films of the 1950s. The films in this volume feature monsters that stand as metaphors for the fears of the time when people had genuine concerns about atomic power and the atom bomb’s potential for the first time in human history to bring about the end of human civilisation. For instance, in the case of Godzilla (1954) the film is an allegory for the destruction and devastation unleashed on Japan by the atomic bomb, with the 400-foot-tall mutant dinosaur Gojira, serving as the visual metaphor. Such monsters represent forces of nature awakened by human science that once brought into being cannot be controlled.",109.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-bmUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-bmUEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=13&source=gbs_api,Volume 1: Here There Be Monsters,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-bmUEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book--bmUEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Journey to the Center of the Earth,['Jules Verne'],"A classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne, this work is one of the most well-known subterranean fictions to this day. It inspired many similar works and adaptations. First published in 1864 in French as Voyage au centre de la Terre, it was quickly translated to English by several different publishers in the 1870s. The current edition was based on the translation by Frederick Amadeus Malleson that was published by Ward Lock & Co Ltd. in 1877. Our protagonist is Axel, whose overcautious and unadventurous spirit contrasts with that of his uncle Professor Otto Lidenbrock, an eccentric professor of geology. When Professor Lidenbrock obtains a mysterious runic-coded note in the manuscript of an Icelandic saga, he is determined to decipher it. Axel inadvertently solves the code and, much to his chagrin, discovers that it is a set of directions left by a sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist to reach the center of the earth via the volcano Snæfelljökull. Reluctantly, Axel joins his uncle on a trip to Iceland, and with the aid of a local guide, Hans, begins an adventure towards the center of the earth, where they will encounter giant mushrooms and insects, an island with an enormous geyser, and battle pre-historic reptiles. One of Verne’s most well-known works, this novel is a testament to Verne’s love of geology, science, and cryptography. This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.",275.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OhsZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OhsZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=32&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OhsZEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-OhsZEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

An extinction-level asteroid is hurtling toward Earth, and the descendants of ancient Atlantis have returned from the stars in their silver ships to offer humanity help. But there's a catch.

No turning back. The human race has been divided. The chosen few live in the safety of the domes, watching through their glass walls as those left on the outside suffer and die. But desperation has brought invention. New drugs have the ability to alter humans, giving them the strength to roam the poisoned night unafraid—but survival comes at a terrible price. Seventeen-year-old Nola Kent has spent her life in the domes, training to protect her little piece of the world within the glass. The mission of the domes is to preserve the human race, not to help the sick and starving. When the fate of an outsider child falls into her hands, Nola dares to venture beyond the security of her home, diving into a world of darkness and vampires.

Posthumanism and the Graphic Novel in Latin America,"['Edward King', 'Joanna Page']","Latin America is experiencing a boom in graphic novels that are highly innovative in their conceptual play and their reworking of the medium. Inventive artwork and sophisticated scripts have combined to satisfy the demand of a growing readership, both at home and abroad. Posthumanism and the Graphic Novel in Latin America, which is the first book-length study of the topic, argues that the graphic novel is emerging in Latin America as a uniquely powerful force to explore the nature of twenty-first century subjectivity. The authors place particular emphasis on the ways in which humans are bound to their non-human environment, and these ideas are productively drawn out in relation to posthuman thought and experience. The book draws together a range of recent graphic novels from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Uruguay, many of which experiment with questions of transmediality, the representation of urban space, modes of perception and cognition, and a new form of ethics for a posthuman world.

R.J. Rummel: An Assessment of His Many Contributions,['Nils Petter Gleditsch'],"This book is open access under a CC BY license. The book provides a critical and constructive assessment of the many contributions to social science and politics made by Professor R. J. Rummel. Rummel was a prolific writer and an important teacher and mentor to a number of people who in turn have made their mark on the profession. His work has always been controversial. But after the end of the Cold War, his views on genocide and the democratic peace in particular have gained wide recognition in the profession. He was also a pioneer in the use of statistical methods in international relations. His work in not easily classified in the traditional categories of international relations research (realism, idealism, and constructivism). He was by no means a pacifist and his views on the US-Soviet arms race led him to be classified as a hawk. But his work on the democratic peace has become extremely influential among liberal IR scholars and peace researchers.

The War of the Worlds,['H. G. Wells'],"H. G. Wells’ classic tale of alien invasion has to this day never been out of print. Like many works of the era, it was originally published as a serial—though the publisher, Pearson’s Magazine, demanded to know the ending before committing to publication. The War of the Worlds, with its matter-of-fact narrative style and deft mixture of contemporary science and fictionalized interstellar war machines, became an instant hit. Its themes of colonialism, social Darwinism, good and evil, and total war still resonate with modern-day readers, so much so that it’s been continuously adapted for screen, radio, television, comics, and print.

Being Modern,"['Robert Bud', 'Paul Greenhalgh', 'Frank James', 'Morag Shiach']","In the early decades of the twentieth century, engagement with science was commonly used as an emblem of modernity. This phenomenon is now attracting increasing attention in different historical specialties. Being Modern builds on this recent scholarly interest to explore engagement with science across culture from the end of the nineteenth century to approximately 1940. Addressing the breadth of cultural forms in Britain and the western world from the architecture of Le Corbusier to working class British science fiction, Being Modern paints a rich picture. Seventeen distinguished contributors from a range of fields including the cultural study of science and technology, art and architecture, English culture and literature examine the issues involved. The book will be a valuable resource for students, and a spur to scholars to further examination of culture as an interconnected web of which science is a critical part, and to supersede such tired formulations as 'Science and culture'.",440.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6oxxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6oxxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=72&source=gbs_api,Cultural Impact Science,No link available

On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins with Sandra Blakeslee (Summary),"['QuickRead', 'Lea Schullery']","Do you want more free book summaries like this? Download our app for free at https://www.QuickRead.com/App and get access to hundreds of free book and audiobook summaries. Learn How a New Understanding of the Brain Will Lead to the Creation of Truly Intelligent Machines. In today’s modern world, our relationship with computers has become revolutionary with the invention of artificial intelligence. Today, we can talk to our devices and, even better, they can answer. We have created a world that, in the past, was only seen in science fiction books and movies. But there is still something missing. Artificial intelligence is just that… artificial. But what if we could create computers that have real intelligence? What if we built computers that work the same way our brains do? Through On Intelligence, Hawkins presents a powerful theory of how the human brain works and explains why computers are not intelligent. According to this theory, we will finally be able to build intelligent machines. So what kind of intelligent machines can we begin to expect in the future? How will these machines change the way we live? Or interact with one another? As you read, you’ll learn how the human brain is superior to the computer, why robots will never take over the world, and what kinds of technology you might see in the future.",,['Study Aids'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H03sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=H03sDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=155&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H03sDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-H03sDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Realities and Futures of Work,['David Peetz'],"What do we know about the current realities of work and its likely futures? What choices must we make and how will they affect those futures? Many books about the future of work start by talking about the latest technology, and focus on how technology is going to change the way we work. And there is no doubt that technology will have huge impacts. However, to really understand the direction in which work is going, and the impact that technology and other forces will have, we need to first understand where we are. This book covers topics ranging from the ‘mega-drivers of change’ at work, power, globalisation and financialisation, to management, workers, digitalisation, the gig economy, gender, climate change, regulation and deregulation. In doing this, it refers to some of the great works of science fiction. It demolishes several myths, such as that the employment relationship is doomed, that we are all heading to becoming ‘freelancers’ or ‘gig workers’ one day, that most jobs will be destroyed by technological change, that the growth in jobs will mainly be in STEM fields, that we will no longer value collectivism as we will all be ‘individuals’, or that the death of unionism is inevitable. The Realities and Futures of Work also rejects the idea of technological determinism—that whatever will be, will be, thanks to technological change—and so it refuses to accept that we simply need to prepare to adapt ourselves to the future by judicious training since there is nothing else we can do about it. Instead, this book provides a realistic basis for thinking about both the present and the future. It emphasises the choices we make, and the implications of those choices for the future of work.",423.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xuS3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xuS3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=190&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The title refers to the Southland, a name used by locals to refer to Southern California and Greater Los Angeles. Set in the then-near future of 2008, as part of an alternate history, the novel is an expanded portrait of Los Angeles, and a satiric commentary on the military–industrial complex and the infotainment industry.

Zombies in Western Culture,"['John Vervaeke', 'Christopher Mastropietro', 'Filip Miscevic']","Why has the zombie become such a pervasive figure in twenty-first-century popular culture? John Vervaeke, Christopher Mastropietro and Filip Miscevic seek to answer this question by arguing that particular aspects of the zombie, common to a variety of media forms, reflect a crisis in modern Western culture. The authors examine the essential features of the zombie, including mindlessness, ugliness and homelessness, and argue that these reflect the outlook of the contemporary West and its attendant zeitgeists of anxiety, alienation, disconnection and disenfranchisement. They trace the relationship between zombies and the theme of secular apocalypse, demonstrating that the zombie draws its power from being a perversion of the Christian mythos of death and resurrection. Symbolic of a lost Christian worldview, the zombie represents a world that can no longer explain itself, nor provide us with instructions for how to live within it. The concept of 'domicide' or the destruction of home is developed to describe the modern crisis of meaning that the zombie both represents and reflects. This is illustrated using case studies including the relocation of the Anishinaabe of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, and the upheaval of population displacement in the Hellenistic period. Finally, the authors invoke and reformulate symbols of the four horseman of the apocalypse as rhetorical analogues to frame those aspects of contemporary collapse that elucidate the horror of the zombie. Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis is required reading for anyone interested in the phenomenon of zombies in contemporary culture. It will also be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience including students and scholars of culture studies, semiotics, philosophy, religious studies, eschatology, anthropology, Jungian studies, and sociology.",104.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CzkoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CzkoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=276&source=gbs_api,A Twenty-First Century Crisis,No link available

INDIAN SUPERHERO - THE NANOMAN,['SHADAB ASHRAF'],"It is an origin story of an Indian Superhero - THE NANOMAN. Nanoman superpower is based upon Nanoparticles which he controls with different gadgets. Nanoparticles are metallic crystals in the shape of a microscopic cube, inbuilt with the capability to reciprocate as per command. The Nanoparticle rests on Nanoman suit as part of him. And it functions according to the command based upon Nanoman's imagination, conceptualization, and pre-programmed command.

Initially, the Nanoparticle is powered by batteries, but by enhancing its capability, he can harness energy from his body adjoined with other outer sources. The story is based in Mumbai. Two sons, Kumar and Murti of Late Scientist Sir Murti, found a hidden lab in their villa. And everything changed for the brothers who were on the verge of going bankrupt.

The Croxley Master,['Arthur Conan Doyle'],"MR. ROBERT MONTGOMERY was seated at his desk, his head upon his hands, in a state of the blackest despondency. Before him was the open ledger with the long columns of Dr. Oldacre's prescriptions. At his elbow lay the wooden tray with the labels in various partitions, the cork box, the lumps of twisted sealing-wax, while in front a rank of empty bottles waited to be filled. But his spirits were too low for work. He sat in silence, with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands. Outside, through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate, a line of enormous chimneys like Cyclopean pillars upheld the lowering, dun-coloured cloud-bank. For six days in the week they spouted smoke, but to-day the furnace fires were banked, for it was Sunday. Sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man. There was nothing in the surroundings to cheer a desponding soul, but it was more than his dismal environment which weighed upon the medical assistant. His trouble was deeper and more personal. The winter session was approaching. He should be back again at the University completing the last year which would give him his medical degree; but alas! he had not the money with which to pay his class fees, nor could he imagine how he could procure it. Sixty pounds were wanted to make his career, and it might have been as many thousands for any chance there seemed to be of his obtaining it.",92.0,['Boxers (Sports)'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rOE0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rOE0AAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=327&source=gbs_api,A Great Tale of the Prize Ring,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rOE0AAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-rOE0AAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Great Boer War,['Arthur Conan Doyle'],"During the course of the war some sixteen Editions of this work have appeared, each of which was, I hope, a little more full and accurate than that which preceded it. I may fairly claim, however, that the absolute mistakes made have been few in number, and that I have never had occasion to reverse, and seldom to modify, the judgments which I have formed. In this final edition the early text has been carefully revised and all fresh available knowledge has been added within the limits of a single volume narrative. Of the various episodes in the latter half of the war it is impossible to say that the material is available for a complete and final chronicle. By the aid, however, of the official dispatches, of the newspapers, and of many private letters, I have done my best to give an intelligible and accurate account of the matter. The treatment may occasionally seem too brief but some proportion must be observed between the battles of 1899-1900 and the skirmishes of 1901-1902. My private informants are so numerous that it would be hardly possible, even if it were desirable, that I should quote their names. Of the correspondents upon whose work I have drawn for my materials, I would acknowledge my obligations to Messrs. Burleigh, Nevinson, Battersby, Stuart, Amery, Atkins, Baillie, Kinneir, Churchill, James, Ralph, Barnes, Maxwell, Pearce, Hamilton, and others.

The Babysitter and The Man Upstairs (Urban Legend),['Drac Von Stoller'],"Jamie was thumbing through the newspaper in search of a weekend job for the summer. She was sixteen years old and needed the extra money to help save for textbooks when she starts college in the fall. She tossed the newspaper on the floor frustrated with no results. Then one of the newspaper pages flipped over to the last page of the classifieds and there it was in small print, ""babysitter needed for the summer."" She said, ""How did I miss this, maybe, I passed over it because it didn't say weekends only."" Jamie called the number, and a middle-aged woman answered, and said, ""May I help you?"" ""Yes, you can. I am interested in a babysitting job, but wasn't sure if this was an everyday thing or just weekends only,"" asked Jamie. ""I'm sorry, but I meant to put weekends only, but I was in a hurry,"" explained the woman. ""If you're looking to babysit every day, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you,"" said the woman. ""No, this is exactly what I wanted. When can I start?"" asked Jamie. ""Well, can you start next weekend around five pm?"" said the woman. ""That sounds perfect! I'll see you then,"" replied Jamie. Jamie hung up the phone and was excited about having a job. That would ease her mind about how she was going to be able to pay for her textbooks. The week passed by like a rocket, and it was Saturday, and Jamie showed up to her babysitting job right on time. Jamie knocked on the woman’s front door, and the woman opened the door, and said ""You must be Jamie, so nice to see you."" The woman introduced her children to Jamie and told her she would be back by six pm Sunday night. The woman said bye to Jamie, and her kids, then got in her car, and drove to her business trip. Jamie played some games with the children then the phone rang. Jamie picked up the phone and said, ""Who's there?"" all she heard was heavy breathing, and she hung up the phone, and went back to playing games with the children. Jamie checked her watch and said ""Oh my! It's eight pm, how time flies when you're having fun. Well children it's time for bed."" Jamie escorted the children upstairs to the bedroom that they shared together. She read them a story then a few minutes later the children fell fast asleep. Jamie got out of bed with them and turned the light out, then went downstairs to watch TV before going to sleep. As Jamie was eating popcorn and watching a movie called Halloween it started storming outside. Scary movies really scare the willies out of her, but she still liked watching them anyway.

That's exactly what happened to Johnny Waters. Johnny wasn't afraid of a legend, especially because he never heard of anyone dying on Old Hollow Road. Johnny's grandfather told him that there was an old man that lived in the woods across from Old Hollow Road. Legend has it that a group of young teenagers had been drinking heavily and decided to play a prank on the old man. The teenagers didn't like the old man because he would run them off his property with his shotgun. This just made them angry. They wanted to teach the old man a lesson. The old man's property was their favorite place to camp out because it was secluded deep in the woods. One day when the group of teenagers came by the old man's property after dark they decided it was time to teach the old man a lesson. One of the teenagers went back to his car to get a gas can. When he returned back to the group, he told them he was going to burn the old man's cabin to the ground. After about two more six packs the teens were out for blood. They poured gas all around the cabin and set it ablaze. The teens stood and watched the old man's cabin burn to the ground. They heard the old man screaming from the cabin, ""I'm burning, please save me!"" The teenagers just laughed and passed the two six packs around until the beer was gone. They tossed their empty beer cans in the fire where the old man's cabin used to sit. Supposedly, one of the teenagers heard the old man say, ""If you ever ride down Old Hollow Road in your car, don't look in your rear view mirror.

Astronomy for Amateurs,"['Camille Flammarion', 'Frances Alice Welby']","The Science of Astronomy is sublime and beautiful. Noble, elevating, consoling, divine, it gives us wings, and bears us through Infinitude. In these ethereal regions all is pure, luminous, and splendid. Dreams of the Ideal, even of the Inaccessible, weave their subtle spells upon us. The imagination soars aloft, and aspires to the sources of Eternal Beauty. What greater delight can be conceived, on a fine spring evening, at the hour when the crescent moon is shining in the West amid the last glimmer of twilight, than the contemplation of that grand and silent spectacle of the stars stepping forth in sequence in the vast Heavens? All sounds of life die out upon the earth, the last notes of the sleepy birds have sunk away, the Angelus of the church hard by has rung the close of day. But if life is arrested around us, we may seek it in the Heavens. These incandescing orbs are so many points of interrogation suspended above our heads in the inaccessible depths of space.... Gradually they multiply. There is Venus, the white star of the shepherd. There Mars, the little celestial world so near our own. There the giant Jupiter. The seven stars of the Great Bear seem to point out the pole, while they slowly revolve around it.... What is this nebulous light that blanches the darkness of the heavens, and traverses the constellations like a celestial path? It is the Galaxy, the Milky Way, composed of millions on millions of suns!... The darkness is profound, the abyss immense.... See! Yonder a shooting star glides silently across the sky, and disappears!...",404.0,['Astronomy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kOPAYylJL6wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kOPAYylJL6wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=350&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kOPAYylJL6wC&rdid=book-kOPAYylJL6wC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Chokepoint Capitalism,"['Rebecca Giblin', 'Cory Doctorow']","A call to action for the creative class and labor movement to rally against the power of Big Tech and Big Media Corporate concentration has breached the stratosphere, as have corporate profits. An ever-expanding constellation of industries are now monopolies (where sellers have excessive power over buyers) or monopsonies (where buyers hold the whip hand over sellers)—or both. In Chokepoint Capitalism, scholar Rebecca Giblin and writer and activist Cory Doctorow argue we’re in a new era of “chokepoint capitalism,” with exploitative businesses creating insurmountable barriers to competition that enable them to capture value that should rightfully go to others. All workers are weakened by this, but the problem is especially well-illustrated by the plight of creative workers. From Amazon’s use of digital rights management and bundling to radically change the economics of book publishing, to Google and Facebook’s siphoning away of ad revenues from news media, and the Big Three record labels’ use of inordinately long contracts to up their own margins at the cost of artists, chokepoints are everywhere. By analyzing book publishing and news, live music and music streaming, screenwriting, radio and more, Giblin and Doctorow deftly show how powerful corporations construct “anti-competitive flywheels” designed to lock in users and suppliers, make their markets hostile to new entrants, and then force workers and suppliers to accept unfairly low prices. In the book’s second half, Giblin and Doctorow then explain how to batter through those chokepoints, with tools ranging from transparency rights to collective action and ownership, radical interoperability, contract terminations, job guarantees, and minimum wages for creative work. Chokepoint Capitalism is a call to workers of all sectors to unite to help smash these chokepoints and take back the power and profit that’s being heisted away—before it’s too late.",398.0,['Business & Economics'],5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CzuAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CzuAEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=363&source=gbs_api,,No link available

One of these cornerstone mysteries is the factual history of business, economics, and even day-to-day technologies. If it is considered that ''money rules the world,'' then why, is it the case, there is no single reasonable idea, how and where money came from? What was the progression of metamorphosis and transformations that allowed impersonal pieces of paper and electronic signals to become today the central exchange equivalent? There is no history of business, history of economy or history of human civilization. These categories simply do not exist as a reflection of scientifically established knowledge of laws. Many researchers, treading the pathway of obstacles derived from false data, simply give up in hopelessness. ''Business is business!'' is the verdict—a multifaceted conclusion and restless justification of why some suffer severe punishment for things that are authorized to others. These phenomena, these elements of our lives, did not arise ''on their own.'' Everything has its history, its consistent tendency and its course of evolution. Business and its configuration were developed, designed, and commissioned by some on a global level. Who, in this case, is more competent to answer recurring questions about the true essence of business and economy? Certainly, immediate ''architects'' or creators. Unfortunately, the beginning and escalation of business took place several centuries ago, and it is not possible to find an architect and address to him any articulate questions. Nevertheless, we can bring together leading scholars, experts and practitioners from different fields of science and other spheres who have dedicated their professional activities to solving concrete business problems and untangling the oxymorons prevalent in the field. The International Interdisciplinary Conference ""Real Life and Real Economics"", united leading scholars, experts, practitioners, financial journalists and thinkers for the discussion on 6 different online panels, where the following questions were discussed: 1) History of business, technological history of our civilization, contradictions, distortions and invented stories. 2) Self-deception as the foundation of the modern world in Baudrillard's philosophy. 3) Origins of business consultants and the security field. 4) ""Business heroes"" of different times. 5) Origins of business construction elements (human resources, marketing, etc.) 6) People and consumer society (Baudrillard), the place of a person in consumer society. 7) Examples of contradictions in the history of business and technological history. 8) What is the formula of a business? (Which sciences compose it). 9) Where we are at? Who controls the rate of change in industries? 10) How long will consumer society last? Could the ongoing consequences of the pandemic cease its existence? 11) Modern science and pre-modern science. Why are scholars of the XVI-XIX centuries no less inferior but in many ways superior to modern scholars? How do we explain this? 12) What is the mystery of the scientific origins of economics and business.",179.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9Ec3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9Ec3EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=553&source=gbs_api,International interdisciplinary conference,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9Ec3EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9Ec3EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
American Woman's Home,"['Catharine Beecher', 'Harriet Beecher Stowe']","Published in 1869 by the indomitable Beecher sisters, The American Woman's Home is remarkable for both its philosophy and its practicality. A pioneering work of scientific kitchen planning, the book's recommendation for specific work areas, built-in cupboards and shelves, and continuous work surfaces are ideals that, while new at the time, are taken for granted today. The work presupposes a servantless home and teaches the homemaker basic skills on how to cope with such inventions as stoves and refrigerators, as well as providing information on healthful food and drink, care of the sick, and care of the home.

Journey Into Intentionality Of A Woman,['Santosh Jha'],"Beyond biology, morphology; epistemology of form, firmament; ontology of typology; there is a landscape, of probabilities of self; a novel and alternative intentionality. Is that you? There are dimensionalities, on the other side of populism of feminine frontiers and individuality of womanhood. Step in to probe the pandemic of pathologies of perceptions in scammed cultures. Say hello to a new you. Labeling, objectification, insinuations of inferiority and subjugation; as a woman, you faced them all. You’ve been made to believe ‘realities’ about your personhood, against your discretion. You felt conflicted, consternated, even violated handling ‘dualism’ of your womanhood? Dump them; journey your true realities, potentials, as a woman, human with 21st century Science of Self & Intentionality. Since the inception of civilization, humanity has strived to unravel the mysteries of Self or ‘I’ but their journey could not be fruitful as only 21st century modern science has now deciphered the deep and complex mechanism-processes of Intentionality. For a woman; this journey into her true and real Intentionality is the core-critical knowledge she must have as since ages; she has been told and made to accept her own Self and Intentionality, explained and imposed on her, without her own personal and subjective experiences and knowledge. It is almost like you accepting your own face and persona, which a distorted and scammed mirror shows you. Objective, logical and singularly explainable science of Reality, especially the human realities have shown the doors to all hypocritical and stupid perceptional beliefs about almost every aspect of life-living, which humanity has held true since ages. Contemporary scientific knowledge of realities tell us that the Intentionality of your Self or ‘I’; as it stands in perpetuity of interactional loop with that of all Others; may not always be restricted and smothered to this Form-Finality of populist and culturally benchmarked Gender identities and realities, which are assigned to forms. The Reality is too colossal and its causalities are too massively complex to enslave it to and chain it with peripheral element of male-female situation. The Consciousness, cognition, causalities and the Intentionality, which pervades them, are too multidimensional to be restricted to populist gender-validities. This ‘I’ is a huge landscape. The consciousness, this feel and finality of ‘Me’, the subjective self, is a universe in itself. Why? Simply because ‘I’ and Consciousness is probabilistic! The Intentionality is probabilistic. The morphology, the body-mind causalities, the form-finality are only a miniscule aspect of the vastly stretched reality of ‘I’. They are only a ‘context’ and ‘specificity’ for certain causalities and there are infinite contexts for expansive realities. The experiences, feelings, perceptions, purposes, the will, expressions, learning et al are massive landscapes, all constantly and endlessly evolving within ‘I’ in entire lifetime. These landscapes of ‘I’ are interacting with infinite causalities and gender morphology is only a small ‘context’ of these massive interactions. Modern science has added magic into the process of understanding the Self or ‘I’ and its Intentionality. The Intentionality now has scientific basis. Not only human mechanisms and processes; rather, everything about Reality, is now available for completely novel, deeper and holistic understanding and internalization. Many Walls, between You and Me, which hindered and vitiated mutual understanding, now stands crumbled, thanks to the objective knowledge contemporary science has extended to us. ‘I’ can now journey better and deeper into the landscape of ‘your’ Consciousness, as pathways are clearer; broader. I can now journey into your Intentionality, which even ‘You’ may not have ever thought is You and inside You. Knowledge is the cure of all pathologies. Enter the landscape of scientific knowledge, wellness and true empowerment.",,['Psychology'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XGB6EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XGB6EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=580&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XGB6EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XGB6EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

While the state is an evil in all its forms, monarchy is, in many ways, far less pernicious than democracy. Hoppe shows the evolution of government away from aristocracy, through monarchy, and toward the corruption and irresponsibility of democracy to have been identical with the growth of the leviathan state. There is hope for liberty, as Hoppe explains, but it lies not in reversing these steps, but rather through secession and decentralization.

Semantics: A View to Logic of Language,['Kisno'],"I see semantics as one branch of linguistics, which is the study of language: as an area of study parallel to, and interacting with, those syntax and phonology, which deal respectively with the formal patterns of language, and the way in which these are translated into sounds. While syntax and phonology study the structure of expressive possibilities in language, semantics study the meanings that can be expressed. It may convincingly be claimed that viewing semantics as a component discipline of linguistics is the most fruitful and exciting point of departure at the present time. The book of this kind cannot attempt an overall survey of the field of semantics or at least, if it does, it will end up as a superficial compendium of what others have thought about meaning. The only sensible course is to give evidence that linguistics does exist in our life and it is hypocritical not to acknowledge that linguistics is difficult to understand due to its scientificity. Semantics is a non-fiction science through its unique approach to find the meaning of language not by guessing or judging something subjectively. The strength of the integrated view is that it makes possible a transfer to semantics of techniques of analysis which have proved successful with other aspects of language. It has to be conceded that the primary appeal of semantics is an intellectual one, similar in some respects to that of mathematics or any pure science. Only after seeking understanding for understanding’s sake can one acquire the wisdom which consists in using that understanding for good ends.",198.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uoc41AHWvwMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uoc41AHWvwMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=611&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Iron Heel,['Jack London'],"The Iron Heel is a dystopian novel by American writer Jack London, first published in 1908.Generally considered to be ""the earliest of the modern Dystopian"", it chronicles the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States. It is arguably the novel in which Jack London's socialist views are most explicitly on display. A forerunner of soft science fiction novels and stories of the 1960s and '70s, the book stresses future changes in society and politics while paying much less attention to technological changes.[citation needed]The book is unusual among London's writings (and in the literature of the time in general) in being a first-person narrative of a woman protagonist written by a man.

Cyberpunk in a Transnational Context,['Takayuki Tatsumi'],"Mike Mosher’s “Some Aspects of Californian Cyberpunk” vividly reminds us of the influence of West Coast counterculture on cyberpunks, with special emphasis on 1960s theoretical gurus such as Timothy Leary and Marshall McLuhan, who explored the frontiers of inner space as well as the global village. Frenchy Lunning’s “Cyberpunk Redux: Dérives in the Rich Sight of Post-Anthropocentric Visuality” examines how the heritage of Ridley Scott’s techno-noir film Blade Runner (1982) that preceded Gibson’s Neuromancer (1984) keeps revolutionizing the art of visuality, even in the age of the Anthropocene. If you read Lunning’s essay along with Lidia Meras’s “European Cyberpunk Cinema,” which closely analyzes major European cyberpunkish dystopian films Renaissance (2006) and Metropia (2009) and Elana Gomel’s “Recycled Dystopias: Cyberpunk and the End of History,” your understanding of the cinematic and post-utopian possibility of cyberpunk will become more comprehensive. For a cutting-edge critique of cyberpunk manga, let me recommend Martin de la Iglesia’s “Has Akira Always Been a Cyberpunk Comic?” which radically redefines the status of Akira (1982–1993) as trans-generic, paying attention to the genre consciousness of the contemporary readers of its Euro-American editions. Next, Denis Taillandier’s “New Spaces for Old Motifs? The Virtual Worlds of Japanese Cyberpunk” interprets the significance of Japanese hardcore cyberpunk novels such as Goro Masaki’s Venus City (1995) and Hirotaka Tobi’s Grandes Vacances (2002; translated as The Thousand Year Beach, 2018) and Ragged Girl (2006), paying special attention to how the authors created their virtual landscape in a Japanese way. For a full discussion of William Gibson’s works, please read Janine Tobek and Donald Jellerson’s “Caring About the Past, Present, and Future in William Gibson’s Pattern Recognition and Guerilla Games’ Horizon: Zero Dawn” along with my own “Transpacific Cyberpunk: Transgeneric Interactions between Prose, Cinema, and Manga”. The former reconsiders the first novel of Gibson’s new trilogy in the 21st century not as realistic but as participatory, whereas the latter relocates Gibson’s essence not in cyberspace but in a junkyard, making the most of his post-Dada/Surrealistic aesthetics and “Lo-Tek” way of life, as is clear in the 1990s “Bridge” trilogy.",122.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gqqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4gqqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Now we are nearly at the end of the first quarter of the twenty-first century, but violence still permeates in our lives at various levels. Various forms of violence occurring at levels of interpersonal, self-directed, collective, state, warfare, child and youth violence, intimate partner violence, environmental violence, and animal violence lay bare the complexity and pervasiveness of the phenomenon, yet it also brings along the necessity to discuss violence from multiple perspectives. Nelson Mandela Dünya Sağlık Örgütü’nün 2002 yılında yayınladığı Şiddet ve Sağlık Hakkında Dünya Raporu’nun önsözünde “yirminci yüzyılın şiddetle mimlenen bir yüzyıl olarak hatırlanacağını” söyler. Bizler, neredeyse yirmi birinci yüzyılın ilk çeyreğinin sonlarını yaşamaktayız, ancak şiddet hayatımıza hala çeşitli düzeylerde nüfuz ediyor. Kişilerarası, öze yöneltilen, kolektif, devlet, savaş, çocuk ve genç şiddeti, yakın eş şiddeti, çevresel şiddet ve hayvan şiddeti gibi çeşitli düzlemlerde vuku bulan şiddet biçimleri olgunun karmaşıklığını ve yaygınlığını açıkça ortaya koymakla beraber şiddet kavramının farklı açılardan tartışılması gerekliliğini de ortaya koymaktadır.

Animal Narratology,['Joela Jacobs'],"Animal Narratology interrogates what it means to narrate, to speak—speak for, on behalf of—and to voice, or represent life beyond the human, which is in itself as different as insects, bears, and dogs are from each other, and yet more, as individual as a single mouse, horse, or puma. The varied contributions to this interdisciplinary Special Issue highlight assumptions about the human perception of, attitude toward, and responsibility for the animals that are read and written about, thus demonstrating that just as “the animal” does not exist, neither does “the human”. In their zoopoetic focus, the analyses are aware that animal narratology ultimately always contains an approximation of an animal perspective in human terms and terminology, yet they make clear that what matters is how the animal is approximated and that there is an effort to approach and encounter the non-human in the first place. Many of the analyses come to the conclusion that literary animals give readers the opportunity to expand their own points of view both on themselves and others by adopting another’s perspective to the degree that such an endeavor is possible. Ultimately, the contributions call for a recognition of the many spaces, moments, and modes in which human lives are entangled with those of animals—one of which is located within the creative bounds of storytelling.",454.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wPQOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wPQOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA321&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=20&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Why is it so challenging to cultivate open government data?,['Jonathan Crusoe'],"Introduction: This compilation licentiate thesis focuses on open government data (OGD). The thesis is based on three papers. OGD is a system that is organized when publishers collect and share data with users, who can unrestrictedly reuse the data. In my research, I have explored why it can be challenging to cultivate OGD. Cultivation is human activities that change, encourage, or guide human organizations towards a higher purpose by changing, introducing, managing, or removing conditions. Here, the higher purpose is OGD to realize believed benefits. Thus, OGD cultivation is an attempt to stimulate actors into organizing as OGD. Problem and Purpose: OGD is believed to lead to several benefits. However, the worldwide OGD movement has slowed down, and researchers have noted a lack of use. Publishers and users are experiencing a set of different impediments that are challenging to solve. In previous research, there is a need for more knowledge about what can impede the OGD organization, cause non-valuable organizing, or even collapse the organization. At the same time, there is a lack of knowledge about how impediments shape the organization of OGD. This gap can make it hard to solve and overcome the impediments experienced by publishers and users. The sought-after knowledge can bring some understanding of the current situation of OGD. In this research, I have viewed the organization of OGD as an ecosystem. The purpose of this thesis is to draw lessons about why it can be challenging to cultivate OGD ecosystems by understanding OGD impediments from an ecosystem perspective. Research Design: I set out to explore OGD through qualitative research from 2016 to 2018. My research started with a pilot case study that led to three studies. The studies are each reported in a paper and the papers form the base of this thesis. The first paper aims to stimulate the conceptually oriented discussion about actors’ roles in OGD by developing a framework that was tested on a Swedish public agency. The second paper has the purpose of expanding the scope surrounding impediments and was based in a review and systematization of previous research about OGD impediments. The third paper presents an exploration of impediments experienced by publishers, users, and cultivators in the Swedish national OGD ecosystem to identify faults. From the three papers, lessons were drawn in turn and together, that are presented in this thesis. Findings: Cultivators when cultivating OGD ecosystems are facing towering challenges. The following three main challenges are identified in this thesis: (1) to cultivate a system that can manage stability by itself without constant involvement, (2) to cultivate a system that is capable of evolving towards a “greater good” by itself, and (3) to have an up-to-date precise vocabulary for a self-evolving system that enables inter-subjective understand for coordinating problem-solving. Contribution: The theoretical contribution of this thesis is that OGD ecosystems can be viewed as a public utility. Moreover, I recommend that researchers approach the organizing of OGD as the cultivation of evolution, rather than the construction of a structure; to consider the stability of the system in growth, value, and participation; and to be cautious with how they label and describe OGD actors. For actors that are cultivating OGD, I recommend that they guide the OGD actors to help them organize; view OGD cultivation as the management of evolution (growth) towards a purpose; and view cultivation as a collaborative effort where they can supply ideas, technologies, practices, and expertise.",80.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IoGQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IoGQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=25&source=gbs_api,Understanding impediments from an ecosystem perspective,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IoGQDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-IoGQDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Re-imagining Japan after Fukushima,['Tamaki Mihic'],"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster (collectively referred to as ‘3.11’, the date of the earthquake), had a lasting impact on Japan’s identity and global image. In its immediate aftermath, mainstream media presented the country as a disciplined, resilient and composed nation, united in the face of a natural disaster. However, 3.11 also drew worldwide attention to the negative aspects of Japanese government and society, thought to have caused the unresolved situation at Fukushima. Spurred by heightened emotions following the triple disaster, the Japanese became increasingly polarised between these two views of how to represent themselves. How did literature and popular culture respond to this dilemma? Re-imagining Japan after Fukushima attempts to answer that question by analysing how Japan was portrayed in post-3.11 fiction. Texts are selected from the Japanese, English and French languages, and the portrayals are also compared with those from non-fiction discourse. This book argues that cultural responses to 3.11 had a significant role to play in re-imagining Japan after Fukushima.",175.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f8DZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=f8DZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA57&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=27&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Shared Margins,"['Samuli Schielke', 'Mukhtar Saad Shehata']","Shared Margins tells of writers, writing, and literary milieus in Alexandria, Egypt’s second city. It de-centres cosmopolitan avant-gardes and secular-revolutionary aesthetics that have been intensively documented and studied since 2011. Instead, it offers a fieldwork-based account of various milieus and styles, and their common grounds and lines of division. Structured in two parts, Shared Margins gives an account of literature as a social practice embedded in milieus that at once enable and limit literary imagination, and of a life-worldly experience of plurality in absence of pluralism that marks literary engagements with the intimate and social realities of Alexandria after 2011. Literary writing, this book argues, has marginality as an at once enabling and limiting condition. It provides shared spaces of imaginary excess that may go beyond the taken-for-granted of a societal milieu, and yet are never unlimited. Literary imagination is part and parcel of such social conflicts and transformations, its role being neither one of resistance against power nor of guidance towards norms, but rather one of open-ended complicity.",288.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-Ac7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-Ac7EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA166&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=28&source=gbs_api,An Ethnography with Writers in Alexandria after the Revolution,No link available

Love in the Time of the Apocalypse,['Gregory Blecha'],"Though a dystopian novel hovering over the imminent collapse of American civilization at the hands of a techno-authoritarian state, ""Love in the Time of the Apocalypse"" is also a book about the triumph of love and humor over the fatal gravitas of life and death. It is part future nightmare part whimsical farce of the present. Love in the Time of the Apocalypse is a work of playful conspiritorial pop-delirium and pastiche full of lovable terrorists, state run breeding houses, Amish casinos, vulgar action scenes, the antichrist, tongue and cheek hyper-masculinity (""perhaps sit-ups can save the world"") and a bourgeois love story to top it all. Readers who love Science Fiction, Dystopian Literature, and Conspiracy Theory will find this book chock full of fresh and clever fare. The speculative details are much more subtle than works on the post-apocalypse. The reader can feel both drawn into a bit of a future shock while at the same time remain anchored in a familiar, albeit, terrifying present. Blecha has a way of pulling from current trends of government suppression of freedoms and stretching them ever so softly to their possible conclusion. Thus, rather than a world of utter totalitarianism such at Orwell's 1984, we are presented with a more plausible, more friendly fascism that a society founded on consumerism and entertainment might bring about. Without coming across as a writer with an agenda, Gregory Blecha offers a strong but playful critique of State power, the smothering inefficiency and corruption of bureaucracy, and the role of the over-stimulated, under-critical herd of middle class consumers and middle managers of a collapsing North America. Tramps,plague victims, nihilists and nymphomaniacs along with the main character, a WASP drawn into their exciting world, make for the heroes of the story. The villains are the lifeless and systematic processes of the Federal Government, the Department of Health, the Department of Overpopulation, and the technological control systems of modern life, and yet even these are rendered with an air of playfulness that allows the reader to smile as the world comes crumbling down.",182.0,['Fiction'],4.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MzwZFPMVIogC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzwZFPMVIogC&pg=PP1&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=34&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Sleeper Awakes,['Herbert George Wells'],"The Sleeper Awakes is H.G. Wells's wildly imaginative story of London in the twenty-second century and the man who by accident becomes owner and master of the world. In 1897 a Victorian gentleman falls into a sleep from which he cannot be waked. During his two centuries of slumber he becomes the Sleeper, the most well known and powerful person in the world. All property is bequeathed to the Sleeper to be administered by a Council on his behalf. The common people, increasingly oppressed, view the Sleeper as a mythical liberator whose awakening will free them from misery. The Sleeper awakes in 2100 to a futuristic London adorned with wondrous technological trappings yet staggering under social injustice and escalating unrest. His awakening sends shock waves throughout London, from the highest meetings of the Council to the workers laboring in factories in the bowels of the city. Daring rescues and villainous treachery abound as workers and capitalists fight desperately for control of the Sleeper.",302.0,['Dystopias'],2.5,8.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VrYsAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VrYsAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=37&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VrYsAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-VrYsAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Judge, Jury, Executioner",['Mitchell P. Jones'],"Disillusioned with a dystopian society a young teenager takes the law into his own hands to avenge his soulmate. But at what price? What would you do for love? Or rather: What wouldn't you do? When Nathan loses Anna — his vibrant, bursting-with-life soulmate, the one girl who completes him — to depression and despair following a vicious rape, he vows revenge against the trio of scumbags involved. Rather than waiting for a justice system he doesn’t believe in to act, he becomes Judge, Jury, Executioner. He hunts down the rapist and those who aided and abetted him hoping this will bring the Anna of old back to him. Instead, much to Nathan’s shock and pain, it has the opposite effect, driving her even further towards a dangerous precipice. Will true love be enough to set things right? One thing’s for sure: no matter what happens, true love is forever. Mitchell P. Jones presents the reader with Nathan’s cold, clear-eyed view of the world and all its faults, a place that hardly has room for love. But, in this world, it is love in the end that rises above all else, turning the coal of daily life into a sparkling diamond.",,['Young Adult Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_-FDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_-FDEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=38&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_-FDEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_-FDEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

This study attempts to respond to these questions by providing results from a selection of case studies taken from German literature of the 19th through the 21st century, including Goethe’s “late style”, Felix Salten, and the output of contemporary writers such as Florian Meimberg’s “twitterature” and Daniel Glattauer’s e-mail novel.

Touch in the Time of Corona,"['Henriette Steiner', 'Kristin Veel']","A chronicle, a memoir, a reflection on the pandemic, and a cultural analysis of the new spatial, social, and epistemological forms that have arisen with it, this volume weaves together cultural history, aesthetics, and urban and digital studies. It looks at the particular ways in which the possibilities for touch, touching and being touched, both physically and affectively, are reconfigured by the pandemic. How are love, care, and humanity’s complex relationships with technology and nature played out in the interval between abandoned city centres and digitally mediated gatherings? How can we comprehend the reconfiguration of relationships through the human response to the pandemic as an experience that concerns us all but affects each of us in different ways? How do we think through the technological and material dependencies that the pandemic situation establishes? And how does this allow us to imagine the world beyond the pandemic—both utopian and dystopian?

Útrásarvíkingar!,['Alaric Hall'],"As the global banking boom of the early twenty-first century expanded towards implosion, Icelandic media began calling the country's celebrity financiers útrásarvíkingar: “raiding vikings.” This new coinage encapsulated the macho, medievalist nationalism which underwrote Iceland's exponential financialisation. Yet within a few days in October 2008, Iceland saw all its main banks collapse beneath debts worth nearly ten times the country's GDP.Hall charts how Icelandic novelists and poets grappled with the Crash over the ensuing decade. As the first English-language monograph devoted to twenty-first-century Icelandic literature, it provides Anglophone readers with an introduction to one of the world's liveliest literary scenes. It also contributes a key case study for understanding global artistic responses to the early twenty-first century crisis of runaway, unregulated capitalism, exploring the struggles of writers to adapt realist forms of art to surreal times.As Iceland's biggest crisis since their independence from Denmark in 1944, the effect of the Crash on the national self-image was as seismic as its effects on the economy. This study analyses the centrality of whiteness and the abjection of the “developing world” in Iceland's post-colonial identity, and shows how Crash-writing explores the collisions of Iceland's traditional, nationalist medievalism with a dystopian, Orientalist medievalism associated with the Islamic world.The Crash in Iceland was instantly recognised as offering important economic insights. This book shows how Iceland also helps us to understand the cultural convulsions that have followed the Financial Crisis widely in the West.",395.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ugSVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ugSVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=55&source=gbs_api,The Literature of the Icelandic Financial Crisis (2008-2014),No link available
Sustainable Food Systems,['Robert Biel'],"Faced with a global threat to food security, it is perfectly possible that society will respond, not by a dystopian disintegration, but rather by reasserting co-operative traditions. This book, by a leading expert in urban agriculture, offers a genuine solution to today’s global food crisis. By contributing more to feeding themselves, cities can allow breathing space for the rural sector to convert to more organic sustainable approaches. Biel’s approach connects with current debates about agroecology and food sovereignty, asks key questions, and proposes lines of future research. He suggests that today’s food insecurity – manifested in a regime of wildly fluctuating prices – reflects not just temporary stresses in the existing mode of production, but more profoundly the troubled process of generating a new one. He argues that the solution cannot be implemented at a merely technical or political level: the force of change can only be driven by the kind of social movements which are now daring to challenge the existing unsustainable order.Drawing on both his academic research and teaching, and 15 years’ experience as a practicing urban farmer, Biel brings a unique interdisciplinary approach to this key global issue, creating a dialogue between the physical and social sciences",154.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tUZLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tUZLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=56&source=gbs_api,The Role of the City,No link available

Late Soviet Culture,"['Thomas Lahusen', 'Gene Kuperman']","As the Soviet Union dissolved, so did the visions of past and future that informed Soviet culture. With Dystopia left behind and Utopia forsaken, where do the writers, artists, and critics who once inhabited them stand? In an ""advancing present,"" answers editor Thomas Lahusen. Just what that present might be--in literature and film, criticism and theory, philosophy and psychoanalysis, and in the politics that somehow speaks to all of these--is the subject of this collection of essays. Leading scholars from the former Soviet Union and the West gather here to consider the fate of the people and institutions that constituted Soviet culture. Whether the speculative glance goes back (to czarist Russia or Soviet Freudianism, to the history of aesthetics or the sociology of cinema in the 1930s) or forward (to the ""market Stalinism"" one writer predicts or the ""open text of history"" another advocates), a sense of immediacy, or history-in-the-making animates this volume. Will social and cultural institutions now develop organically, the authors ask, or is the society faced with the prospect of even more radical reforms? Does the present rupture mark the real moment of Russia's encounter with modernity? The options explored by literary historians, film scholars, novelists, and political scientists make this book a heady tour of cultural possibilities. An expanded version of a special issue of South Atlantic Quarterly (Spring 1991), with seven new essays, Late Soviet Culture will stimulate scholar and general reader alike. Contributors.

The Discovery of Socket Greeny,['Tony Bertauski'],"If you liked Ready Player One and Ender’s Game, you’ll love the thrilling high-tech adventure of Socket Greeny! I was a nobody before I was a legend. I had this funny name and white hair and really didn’t care about anything. But then one day something happened and nothing was ever the same. Change is like that. One day you’re a nothing, the next you’re saving everything. Not everybody. Everything. It’s not that I didn’t want to do what I did. Someone once told me that true nature is a train—you either get on board or get run over. So I got on and let it take me. What I saw… the androids and the off-world creatures. The psychotic minders. It’s out there. The rabbit hole is deep. That’s the thing with the truth. It’s been right in front of us all this time. We just have to see it. Once you do, you’ll never unsee it. Once you know the truth, you can’t ignore it. I was once a nobody and now I’m a legend because I saw the truth about reality, about this universe. And I did something about it.

"Literary Translation, Reception, and Transfer",['Norbert Bachleitner'],"The three concepts mentioned in the title of this volume imply the contact between two or more literary phenomena; they are based on similarities that are related to a form of ‘travelling’ and imitation or adaptation of entire texts, genres, forms or contents. Transfer comprises all sorts of ‘travelling’, with translation as a major instrument of transferring literature across linguistic and cultural barriers. Transfer aims at the process of communication, starting with the source product and its cultural context and then highlighting the mediation by certain agents and institutions to end up with inclusion in the target culture. Reception lays its focus on the receiving culture, especially on critcism, reading, and interpretation. Translation, therefore, forms a major factor in reception with the general aim of reception studies being to reveal the wide spectrum of interpretations each text offers. Moreover, translations are the prime instrument in the distribution of literature across linguistic and cultural borders; thus, they pave the way for gaining prestige in the world of literature. The thirty-eight papers included in this volume and dedicated to research in this area were previously read at the ICLA conference 2016 in Vienna. They are ample proof that the field remains at the center of interest in Comparative Literature.",510.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z43_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z43_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=99&source=gbs_api,,No link available
US-Mexico Borderland Narratives,['Rosemary A. King'],"For over 150 years, borderland authors from both Mexico and the United States have developed novels which owe their narrative power to compelling relationships between literary constructions of space and artistic expressions of conflicts, characters, and cultural encounter. This study explores those relationships by analyzing representations of the spaces in which characters function-whether barrio, ballroom, or border city as well as the places characters inhabit relative to the border-occupying native or foreign territory, traveling temporarily, or settling permanently. Concomitant with close attention to the conceptualization of space in border literature is a foregrounding of the genres that border writers employ, such as historical romance and the Hispanic bildungsroman, as well as the literary traditions from which they draw, such as travel narratives or utopian literature. Assessing geopoetics in border writing from the Mexican American War to the present, including writers such as Helen Hunt Jackson, Jovita Gonzalez, Ernesto Galarza, Americo Paredes, Harriet Doerr, Cormac McCarthy, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Miguel Mendez provides a paradigm for tracing the development and changes in individual responses to this space as well as a broad range of responses based on class and gender. This corpus of literature demonstrates that the various ways in which characters respond to cultural encounter-adapting, resisting, challenging, sympathizing-depends on artistic rendering of spaces and places around them. Thus, the central argument of this project is that character responses to cultural encounters arise out of geopoetics-the artistic expression of space and place-from the earliest to the most recent border narratives.",270.0,['American literature'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uh2AKS_vFZsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uh2AKS_vFZsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=100&source=gbs_api,Geopoetic Representations from the Mexican American War to the Present,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uh2AKS_vFZsC&rdid=book-uh2AKS_vFZsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Mind Connectivity - Return of the Mind,['Connector X'],"""The only knowledge that can make us see the reality and all the existing kinds of knowledge in a new transparent light, is the knowledge of the human mind structure and the way how it connects us to reality."" In the “Age of Connectivity” there should be no losers, but only winners. For this to happen, we need to make the ""Age of Connectivity"" to be mostly about upgrading our individual mind structure and improving its connectivity level, and less about artificial connectivity and artificial intelligence development. Although the last two bring economic advantages, their over-development will inevitably create a lot of losers, and more than that, there is a high risk that we would all become losers by losing completely the control of our lives, in favour of artificial intelligence. MIND CONNECTIVITY it is a new concept that presents a new vision over the human mind structure, intended to restore the balance between the human mind development and artificial technology development in favor of the human mind development. It is not too late to return our full attention towards our individual mind structure, and to acknowledge that, upgrading this “magnificent software” that we naturally possess, it is the only viable way that can upgrade humankind's destiny.",10.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aVmaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aVmaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dystopian&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=174&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aVmaEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aVmaEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Amsterdam Zuidas European Space,['W. G. M. Salet'],"Until the beginning of the nineties, the centre of Amsterdam was regarded as the obvious nucleus of urban and regional economic activity. But since then, issues of accessibility and scale have induced the development of multi-nodal spatial networks on a regional scale. In ten years' time the spatial and economic configuration of the region has changed dramatically. The development of the Zuidas in the coming thirty years offers a strategic chance to furnish this regionalization of urbanity with a new, more appealing structure.

Stories of American Life and Adventure,['Edward Eggleston'],"1895. American novelist and historian, Eggleston's novels depicting early life in southern Indiana have been widely read. The design of this volume is laid out in the Preface: This book is intended to serve three main purposes. One of these is to make school reading pleasant by supplying matter simple and direct in style, and sufficiently interesting and exciting to hold the reader's attention in a state of constant wakefulness; that is, to keep the mind in the condition in which instruction can be received with the greatest advantage. A second object is to cultivate an interest in narratives of fact by selecting chiefly incidents full of action, such as are attractive to the minds of boys and girls whose pulses are yet quick with youthful life. The early establishment of a preference for stories of this sort is the most effective antidote to the prevalent vice of reading inferior fiction for mere stimulation. But the principal aim of this book is to make the reader acquainted with American life and manners in other times.

It is more plot focused than character driven, so it is very different from my other works, such as the Delver Magic series. I am including it for the sake of completeness. I wanted to make all of my work available for anyone interested in my earliest books. If you decide to give Alien Cradle a try, I hope you will also consider some of my other novels.

"With Buller in Natal, Or, A Born Leader",['George Alfred Henty'],"""It will be a long time before the story of the late war can be written fully and impartially. Even among the narratives of those who witnessed the engagements there are many differences and discrepancies, as is necessarily the case when the men who write are in different parts of the field. Until, then, the very meagre military dispatches are supplemented by much fuller details, anything like an accurate history of the war would be impossible. I have, however, endeavored to reconcile the various narratives of the fighting in Natal, and to make the account of the military occurrences as clear as possible. Fortunately this is not a history, but a story, to which the war forms the background, and, as is necessary in such a case, it is the heroes of my tale, the little band of lads from Johannesburg, rather than the leaders of the British troops, who are the most conspicuous characters in the narrative. As these, although possessed of many admirable qualities, had not the faculty of being at two places at once, I was obliged to confine the action of the story to Natal.

Military Memoirs of a Confederate,['Edward Porter Alexander'],"First published in 1907, Military Memoirs of a Confederate is regarded by many historians as one of the most important and dispassionate first-hand general accounts of the American Civil War. Unlike some other Confederate memoirists, General Edward Porter Alexander had no use for bitter “Lost Cause” theories to explain the South’s defeat. Alexander was willing to objectively evaluate and criticize prominent Confederate officers, including Robert E. Lee. The result is a clear-eyed assessment of the long, bloody conflict that forged a nation. The memoir opens with Alexander, recently graduated from West Point, heading to Utah to tamp down the hostile actions of Mormons who had refused to receive a territorial governor appointed by President Buchanan. A few years later, Alexander finds himself on the opposite side of a much larger rebellion—this time aligned with Confederates bent on secession from the Union. In the years that follow, he is involved in most of the major battles of the East, including Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga. Alexander describes each battle and battlefield in sharp detail. Few wartime narratives offer the insight and objectivity of Alexander’s Military Memoirs of a Confederate . Civil war buffs and students of American history have much to learn from this superb personal narrative. Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs. Our list includes biographies on well-known historical figures like Benjamin Franklin, Nelson Mandela, and Alexander Graham Bell, as well as villains from history, such as Heinrich Himmler, John Wayne Gacy, and O.

The Coaxialism,['Sorin Cerin'],"Complete reference edition. A new philosophical system created by Sorin Cerin. Its principles are: 1. The only true philosophy is the one accepting that Man does neither know the Truth, and implicitly, nor philosophy. 2. Man shall never neither know the Absolute Truth nor the Absolute Knowledge because his entire existence is based on the Illusion of Life. 3. Any philosophical system or philosopher which will pretend that says the Truth is liar. 4. The Coaxialism is, by excellence, the philosophy that does NOT pretend that it speaks the Truth, yet that accepts applications which sustain the reporting of the Illusion of Life to the Truth. 5. The Essence of the Truth consists in its reflection at the Elements appeared before its, as are those of Open Knowledge coming from the State of Fact. 6. The Coaxialism accepts operation with the opposites of the opposites of the Existence, with or without to be necessary the reporting to it, determining the Coaxiology. 7. Each Opposite has at Infinite another Opposite identical to it. 8. With as, an Opposite, is farther, so, between it and the Element opposable are inserted a larger number of opposites, with so the similarities between them will be more pronounced, and, with as, the number of opposites intercalated between the two Elements, will be smaller, with so, the contrasts between them will be more pronounced. 9. How can we speak of Universes without substrate in Existence, we can speak of the Knowledge without substrate in essence, hence, without subject. 10. The factor will always be the opposite of the infinity, face to which it will report as finite, just as the Knowledge is reported to the Un-knowledge, and the life to Death. In understanding coaxial, the Factor will be equivalent to God, the Unique Creator but and, by chance, face of his worlds. 11. In the worlds of each Creator Factor and Unique by Chance it will reflect all other Creator Factors and Unique by Chance under form of numbers, from ONE, which is the Primordial Factor, up to an infinite minus ONE of theCreator Factors and Unique Chance.",318.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dxGa_CSrf0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dxGa_CSrf0sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Action+%26+Adventure&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=407&source=gbs_api,Complete Reference Edition,No link available
Dreams,['Sorin Cerin'],"LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISM AT SORIN CERIN CRITICICISM ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL POEMS PhD Professor Ștefan Borbély, emphasizes in the Romanian magazine Contemporanul (Contemporary), no. 10, October 2020, on page 5, under the title Gnoses of Sorin Cerin, that: The multitude of phrases written in capital letters (Nobody's World; The Deep Trace of Pain; The Darkness of Loneliness; The Labyrinth of the Absurd, etc.) indicate the existence of a precise conceptual system within the religious-philosophical poetry of Sorin Cerin, which obviously draws its sap from an ethos, of Christian-Gnostic essence, with the remark that, the canonical protagonists of classical Christianity (Jesus, Mary, the Devil, etc.) do not appear in the soteriological discourse of the volume, although the spiritual finality of the approach is beyond any doubt, because the poet constantly invokes, as the final target of his aspiration, Love, the Eye of Dream, of the Perfection or the Path to Absolute, of the Future. The dichotomous regime of the keywords of the volume is also of Christian origin, because within them the Absolute and the Absurd face, as in Manichaeism, for example, the fate of the world is decided by the battle between the Being of the Light and the Prince of the Darkness. I have deliberately mentioned Manichaeism as a possible source of inspiration for the cosmology created by Sorin Cerin, because, like the ancient apocalypse (that is, of the texts-revelation), the poet opposes the dispersion induced by materiality by building his own mythology, very carefully conceptualized. This is what the great masters of early Christianity did, taking over a tradition that came from pre-Christian times, when, caught in the illusions of the versatile, metamorphic worlds (The Prince of Darkness in Manichaeism is also a metamorphic demiurge, able to give Matter the most attractive forms, not to mention the Maya to the Hindus), the scholar built an independent autarchic universe (or myth), which being of spiritual (crystalline) origin, offered him the ""temple"" necessary for the soteriological exercise. Carefully, then, at every detail of this ""temple"" (which could be a bamboo grove, a monastery in newer times or even a Book), the scholar purified himself with each pebble he placed on the wall of his edifice, finally covering himself with it as if he were doing it with a halo of light. Sorin Cerin's poetry contributes, through each new verse, through each new poem or collection, to the construction of such an autarchic spiritual system. Therefore, the poet's terminology has a precise intrinsic logic: when he says that any Cathedral of the Absurd is built with matter taken from death, when he writes about the Subconscious Stranger or the Frozen Words floating around us like thorns of ice, the meaning of these phrases must be sought within the mythographic system created by the poet, and not interpreted by extrapolation. Let us try, therefore, to decrypt the symbolic and narrative structure of this myth, in order to understand its meaning. The universe that the poet evokes in his verses is one of the endings of cosmic cycle, being, therefore, one of eschatological origin. There are, in it, ""cemeteries of words ,"" ""ruined cathedrals,"" cluttered dawns, which ""crumble,"" or ""broken windows of Heaven,"" in which ""it rains with sharp shards, of moments."" We will not find anywhere in the perimeter of this universe, which seems inspired by the ruins suspended in ether, of the Piranesi, no space of compensation or refuge, the ruin and the dispersion being ubiquitous. Thus, the black, hopeless geography of the volume suggests bringing the faith into an extreme state, of maceration (Thomas d'Aquino's acedia, also interpreted as a torpor), a stage of annulment of being, from which start, further, two alternative paths: that of renunciation and death, respectively that of courage and hope, the purpose of extreme dispersion being to suggest that even in the most prejudicial situations, the life of faith has sufficient inner resources for ascension and ""rebirth,"" because no matter how opaque the world around us would be, there are still, in its deep texture, enough ""seeds of love"", which to we gather them to build a salvation. Sorin Cerin's poetry appears to us, therefore, as one marked by a paradoxical spiritualist optimism, functioning with the logic of an inverted world. The poet constructs, with fervor and syntactic skill, an anti-world (the world of ""cemeteries of words"", of frozen meanings, the world of ""sharp shards"" and the Absurd), which, in the end, is meant to test his faith and to turn him to the redemptive horizon of the Absolute. In quantitative terms, the words and images of the volume belong mainly to the dispersed world, to ""loss, cold and indifferent forgetfulness"", to the Absurd, that is, to an eschatological climate, which the Faith has the call to transcend and correct. The poet goes, however, even further, proposing a cosmology, of the dualistic type, from the category of those used in Gnosis. Let's try to understand it, starting from the poem in the volume, entitled Where we will be forced to stay: We embarked, on the ship of the Vanity, with the name of Happiness, without we knowing, that the ports in which will dock, are those of the Pain and Absurd, followed in the end, by the one called, Death, where we will be forced to stay, forever, separated from the identity of Love, what will be stolen from us, by another Destiny, what will no longer belong to us, for to be carried in the distances, of the Heart of Fire, of the Eternity of the Moment, given somewhere sometime, by your Glances, now lost, among the Flowers of Tears, of the Memories. It is not the only place where Sorin Cerin talks about an aboulic, deceptive destiny, in which humanity was ""closed"", cloistered against its will. In this case, the ""ship of vanity"" docks in ports with exclusively negative connotations, but it is not at all certain that the passengers wanted such a ""cruise"", their destiny carrying them adrift, against their own will, for superior reasons, which they cannot control. In another poem in the volume there is a ""God of No One"", who made the world (or at least part of it) ""without understanding"" that it must be composed (and) of love. This ""careless"" demiurge has operated, from the very beginning on a negative axiological selection, stopping people from reaching the values of the Good directly or hiding the positive ones. The axial term of the whole complex is the Subconscious Stranger, ""which - the poet writes - we have been forbidden to know"". Consequently, mankind let itself caught in a premeditated cosmic ""mistake,"" which hindered its path to fulfillment, that is, to Love. The Subconscious Stranger appears in several of Sorin Cerin's poems, he having the force of an obsession, with recuperative value. Living in the torn, dispersed universe of ""absurd"" materiality, the poet does nothing but move away from the Subconscious Stranger, salvation demanding, on the contrary, a path in the opposite direction, towards the recovery of the Subconscious and its putting in harmony with the Absolute. The precondition of ""return"" (an essential term for Gnosis) represents it, the internalization of Love: the sharing, from its substance, the preparation of transfiguration. Thus, having all the constitutive elements of the poet's personal poetic mythology, we can only reconstruct it. The starting point is, as in Gnosis, the existence of a ""Foreign God"" (called by the poet, the God of No One), who mispronounced, ""carelessly"" the Words of Genesis, revealing - without wanting, probably - a world unilaterally abstract, ""absurd,"" in which the human spirit is put to the test. The will does not help them either, as we have seen that it happens with the metaphor of the drifting ship, because the world was created from the beginning wrong, with the normal meanings reversed. The major symbol of the volume expresses, therefore, a metaphysical trap: the human being is caught in an ironic ""game"", of eschatological type, from which, apparently, he has no way out. But the impasse turns out to be only apparent, because the builder of his own sublime edifice, that is, the poet, has specific, soteriological powers, through which the gate of salvation opens. All these powers are anti-systemic, ie anti-eschatological. Did ""God of No One"" put wrong words in the world which he created? The poet's purpose is to find the true ones - and to write them, in order to make them accessible and to those around him. Has the world headed, unknowingly, to wandering, dryness, and dispersion ?: the poet's purpose is to find meanings, significations and sources of energy, and to show them and to others, in order to replace the fragmented world with the promise of a beautiful, whole, bright one. Did the forces of matter stand in the way of the Absurd and of opacity? The purpose of the poet - and, implicitly, of man - is to plant Love in souls and to return toward the Absolute. Anyone can operate these essentialized retroversions, because, in the end, poet and man mean, in Sorin Cerin's system of thinking, about the same thing: two qualitatively related hypostases of the religious man, of the One who Believes. PhD Professor Al Cistelecan within the heading Avant la lettre, under the title Between reflection and attitude, appeared in the magazine Familia nr.11-12 November-December 2015, pag.16-18, Al Cistelecan considers about the poetry of meditation, of Sorin Cerin, that: ""From what I see, Sorin Cerin is a kind of volcano textually, in continuously, and maximum eruption, with a writing equally frantic, as and, of convictions. In poetry,relies on gusts reflexive and on the sapiential enthusiasm, cultivating, how says alone in the subtitle of the Non-sense of the Existence, from here the poems ""of meditation"".One approach among all risky - not of today, yesterday, but from always - because he tend to mix where not even is, the work of poetry, making a kind of philosophizing versified, and willy-nilly, all kinds of punishments and morality. Not anymore is case to remind ourselves of the words said by Maiorescu, to Panait Cerna, about ""philosophical poetry,"" because the poet, them knows, and, he very well, and precisely that wants to face: the risk of to work only in idea, and, of to subordinate the imaginative, to the conceptual.Truth be told, it's not for Sorin Cerin, no danger in this sense, for he is in fact a passional, and never reach the serenity and tranquility Apolline of the thought, on the contrary, recites with pathos rather from within a trauma which he tries to a exorcise, and to sublimates, into radical than from inside any peace of thought or a reflexive harmonies.Even what sounds like an idea nude, transcribed often aphoristic, is actually a burst of attitude, a transcript of emotion - not with coldness, but rather with heat (was also remarked, moreover, manner more prophetic of the enunciations).But, how the method, of, the taking off, lyrical, consists in a kind of elevation of everything that comes, up to the dignity of articulating their reflexive (from where the listing, any references to immediately, whether biographical or more than that), the poems by Cerin, undertake steep in the equations big existential and definitive, and they not lose time in, domestic confessions. They attack the Principle of reality, not its accidents. Thus, everything is raised to a dignity problematic, if no and of other nature, and prepared for a processing, densified. Risks of the formula, arise fatal, and here, because is seen immediately the mechanism of to promote the reality to dignity of the lyrism.One of the mechanisms comes from expressionist heritage (without that Sorin Cerin to have something else in common with the expressionists), of the capitalized letter, through which establishes suddenly and unpredictably, or humility radicalized , or panic in front of majesty of the word.Usually the uppercase, baptizes the stratum ""conceptual"" (even if some concepts are metaphors), signaling the problematic alert.It is true, Sorin Cerin makes excess and wastage, of the uppercase, such that, from a while, they do not more create, any panic, no godliness, because abundance them calms effects of this kind, and spoil them into a sort of grandiloquence.The other mechanism of the elevation in dignity rely on a certain - perhaps assumed, perhaps premeditated - pretentious discourse, on a thickening lexical, and on a deep and serious declamation.It is insinuated - of lest, even establishes - and here is an obvious procedure of imaginative recipe, redundant over tolerant. How is and normal - even inevitable - in a lyrical of reflection what wants to coagulate around certain cores conceptual, the modality immediate of awareness of these nodes conceptual, consists in materializing the abstractions, making them sensual is just their way of to do epiphany lyrical.But at, Sorin Cerin, imaginative mechanics is based on a simple use of the genitive, which materialize the abstractions, (from where endless pictures like ""the thorns of the Truth,"" ""chimney sweeps of the Fulfillments,"" "" the brushes of Deceptions"" etc. etc.), under, which most often is a button of personification.On the scale of decantation in metaphors we stand, thus, only on the first steps, what produces simultaneously, an effect of candor imaginative (or discoursive), but and one of uniformity.Probable but that this confidence in the primary processes is due to the stake on decanting of the thought, stake which let, in subsidiary, the imaginative action (and on the one symbolized more so) as such. But not how many or what ideas roam, through Sorin Cerin's poems are, however the most relevant, thing (the idea, generally, but and in this particular case, has a degree of indifference, to lyricism).On the contrary, in way somewhat paradoxically, decisive, not only defining, it's the attitude in which they gather, the affect in which coagulates.Beneath the appearance of a speech projected on ""thought"", Sorin Cerin promotes, in fact, an lyricism (about put to dry) of, emotions existential (not of intimate emotions). The reflexivity of the poems is not, from this perspective, than a kind of penitential attitude, an expression of hierarchies, of violent emotions. Passionate layer is, in reality, the one that shake, and he sees himself in almost all its components, from the ones of blaming, to the ones of piety, or tenderness sublimated (or, on the contrary, becoming sentimentalist again). The poet is, in substance, an exasperated of state of the world and the human condition and starting from here, makes exercises with sarcasm (cruel, at least, as, gush), on account of ""consumer society"" or on that of the vanity of ""Illusions of the Existence"". It's a fever of a figures of style that contains a curse, which gives impetus to the lyrics, but which especially highlights discoursive, the exasperation in front of this general degradation. So general, that she comprised and transcendental, for Sorin Cerin is more than irritated by the instrumentalization of the God (and, of the faith) in the world today. Irritation in front of corruption the sacred, reaches climax, in lyrics of maximum, nerve blasphemous (""Wickedness of Devil is called Evil, / while of the God, Good. "", but and others, no less provocative and"" infamous "" at the address the Godhead); but this does not happen, than because of the intensity and purity of his own faith (Stefan Borbely highlighted the energy of fervor from the poetry of Cerin), from a kind of devotional absolutism. For that not the lyrics, of challenge and blame, do, actually Cerin, on the contrary: lyrics of devotion desperate and passionate, through which him seeks ""on Our True God / so different from the one of cathedrals of knee scratched / at the cold walls and inert of the greed of the Illusion of Life "". It is the devotional fever from on, the reverse, of imprecations and sarcasm, but precisely she is the one that contaminates all the poems. From a layer of ideals, squashed, comes out, with verve passionate, the attitudes, of Cerin, attitudes eruptive, no matter how, they would be encoded in a lyrical of reflections. "" PhD Professor Elvira Sorohan - An existentialist poet of the 21st Century To fully understand the literary chronicle written by Elvira Sorohan in Convorbiri Literare, “Literary Conversations”, which refers to an article written by Magda Cârneci regarding Trans-poetry, and published in România literară, “Romania literary”, where specified what namely is poetry genuine, brilliant, the great poetry, on which a envies the poets of the last century, Elvira Sorohan, specifies in the chronicle dedicated to the poetry of Cerin, from, Convorbiri Literare, “Literary Conversations”, number 9 (237), pages 25-28, 2015 under the title An existentialist poet of the 21st century, that:Without understanding what is ""trans-poetry"", which probably is not more poetry, invoking a term coined by Magda Cârneci, I more read, however, poetry today and now I'm trying to say something about one certain.Dissatisfied of ""insufficiency of contemporary poetry"" in the same article from in România literară, ""Literary Romania"", reasonably poetess accuses in block, how, that what ""delivers"" now the creators of poetry, are not than notations of ""little feeling"", ""small despairs"" and ""small thinking. ""Paraphrasing it on Maiorescu, harsh critical of the diminutives cultivated by Alecsandri, you can not say than that poetry resulting from such notation is also low (to the cube, if enumeration stops at three).The cause identified by Magda Cârneci, would be the lack of inspiration, that tension psychical, specific the men of art, an experience spontaneous, what gives birth, uncontrollably, at creation.It is moment inspiring, in the case of poetry, charged of impulses affective, impossible to defeated rationally, an impulse on that it you have or do not it have, and, of, which is responsible the vocation.Simple, this is the problem, you have vocation, you have inspiration. I have not really an opinion formed about poetry of Magda Cârneci, and I can not know, how often inspiration visits her, but if this state is a grace, longer the case to look for recipes for to a induces ?And yet, in the name of the guild, preoccupation the poetess, for the desired state, focuses interrogative: ""... the capital question that arises is the following: how do we to have access more often, more controlled and not just by accident, to those states intense, at the despised <inspiration>, at those levels, others of ours, for which the poetry has always been a witness (sic!) privileged "".We do not know whom belongs the contempt, but we know that the inspiration is of the poet born, not made.The latter not being than a craftsman and an artist.I have in front three volumes of lyrics of the poet, less known and not devoid of inspiration, Sorin Cerin, ordered in a logical decrescendo, understandable, Non - sense of the Existence, the Great silences, Death, all appeared in 2015, at the Publishing Paco, from Bucharest.After the titular ideas, immediately is striking, and poetic vocabulary of the first poem, and you're greeted with the phrase ""Illusion of Life"" that spelled with capital letters.It is, in substance, an expression inherited from vocabulary consecrated of the existentialist, enough to suspect what brand will have the poems.Move forward with reading, being curious to see you how the poet remains on same chord of background, and how deep, how seriously lives in this idea, not at all new.And it is not new for that the roots of the existentialism, reformulated modern, draw their sap from the skepticism of biblical, melancholic Ecclesiastes, discouraged, in the tragic consciousness of finitude as destiny.It is the King biblical, an, existentialist avant la lettre.He discovers that "" weather is to you be born, and a time is to die"", otherwise ""all is hunting of wind"". What else can be said new in our time, even in personal formula, when the existentialism has been intensively supported philosophically, in centuries XIX, and, XX, from Kierkegaard and up to Sartre, with specific nuances.A poem in the terms, of the existentialism status, more can interested the being of the our days, slave of the visual image and the Internet, only through adaptations or additions updated, complementary the central idea, and not finally, by the power of the return over of the self.It is about what you are trying to achieve the poet Sorin Cerin, leaving us, from the beginning, the impression that he lives the miracle creative, the inspiration. Wanting to guide the reader to search for a specific kind of poetry cultivated in these volumes (with one and the same cover), author subtitled them, ne varietur ""Poems of meditation"", as and are at the level of ideas.But how deep and how personal, is the meditation, you can not say than at the end of reading, when you synthesize what namely aspects of ontology and from what perspective, intellectual and emotional, them develop the poet.Certainly, the existentialist poetry vocabulary universal, recognizable, is now redistributed in an another topic, what leads to combinations surprising of new , some daring, or terribly tough, such as those concerning the church.Reading only one of the three volumes is like as you them read on all, are singing on same chord with minimal renewal from, a poem to another. The poet closes in a unitary conceptual sphere, from here the specific rhetoric.Wherever you open one of the volumes, you are in the center of the universe poetic of the same ideas, the same attitude of skepticism outraged.At the level of language, the same vocabulary, well-tuned with the conceptual sphere, is recombined in new and new phrases with updates related to today's environment, and even immediately of the Being, thrown into the world to atone for the ""Original Sin"".It is known, because sages said, ""Eva's son does not live in a world devoid of wails"".The ambition to build a personal meditation, impossible to achieve at the level of poetic vocabulary, already tired, is compensated by the art of combination of the words, without being able to avoid redundant frequency of some phrases.The most frequent, sometimes deliberately placed and twice in the same poem is ""Illusion of Life"".Dozens of others keywords, complementary, surprises by ostentatious use, to emphasize the idea of ""Non-sense of Existence"". Are preferred, series of words written with uppercase: ""Moment,"" ""Immortality,"" ""Illusion,"" ""Absurd,"" ""Silence,"" ""Death,"" ""Eternity"", ""Absolute Truth"", ""Dream"", ""Free Will"", ""Original Sin"", ""Love"", ""Loneliness"", ""Alienation"", ""God"" and many others.The phrase brings here and now, living problematized of the existence is ""Consumer Society"".Is released from poetry a frenzy of duplication of word, what supports the idea.Often this exuberant energy of rearrangement of words, covers what you looking for in poems composed on one and the same theme, namely, living intense affective of feeling of ""illusion of life"" inside, not outside. Here, we more mention of manner to distinguish the expressive words spelled with a capital letter.Rain of uppercase tends to flood few basic meanings of the poems.And more there's a particularity, the punctuation.After each verse, finished or not as, understood, grammatical or not, it put a comma; the point is put preferably only after the last verse.Otherwise than biblical Ecclesiastes, our poet, more revolted, than melancholic, do hierarchies of vanities pretty little ordered that you to can follow clear ideas.The significances is agglomerating, in one and the same poem, like Hierarchy of the Vanity.But it's not the only one.Of blame can be contemporary reality which provokes on multiple planes, poet's sensibility.The word ""the vanity"" is engaged in a combination serious, sharp, put to accompany even the phenomenon of birth of the world, for to suggest, finally, by joins culinary very original, willfully, vulgar, disgust, ""nausea"", ŕ la Sartre, left behind by the consciousness of the absurd of existence. I sent at the poem, Industry Meat Existential: ""Plow of the Vanity dig deep, / in the dust of the Existence, / wanting to sow the genes of the Illusion of Life, / for to be born the World, / after a prolonged gestation, / in womb without limits, of the Lie, / that rests on Truth for to exist, / ... ravens blacks of the thoughts, / by developing, / A true Industry of the Meat Existential, / beginning, / from steaks of, dreams on the barbecue of the Absurd, / up to, / sausage of highest quality of the Hopelessness. ""What you find in this poem: paradox, nonsense, nihilism, disillusionment, dreams made ashes, all this and more will multiply, kaleidoscopic recombine in all creation contained in these volumes.If, the notions and synthetic concepts contained in words maintains their meaning constant, the fate of the ""word"" is not the same, seems to go toward exhaustion, as and the force of renewal of poetry.Have and the words their fate, apart from poetry, as the poet says. At first, paradoxically, ""Autumn sentimental"" is forsaken by the ""harvests passionate of words"" frantically collected, by the temper ignited of the poet in love only of certain words, those from existentialist semantics.Sometimes, ""Flocks, of words, / furrow the sky of Memories"".In registry changed, the word is tormented as a tool of media, violent, rightly incriminated of poet: ""Words lacustrine / cry in pots of Martyrs, / put at the windows of brothels of Newspapers ..."".Is deplored the fate of the words employed unusual, grotesque: ""At butchery of Words, / in the street corner of the Destiny / are sold bones of phrases rotten, / legs of meanings for fried ..."".And with this fragment I have illustrated the originality resentful word combinations, which give free course the ideas, a poetic attitude provoked by the revolt against the nonsense of existence. Ultimately is metaphorise ""the winter of the Words, / which snows over our Days ..."" and is deplored their fate, the falling ""in the Mud, of some Words, / obscene and full of invective"", and finally, their death: ""Cemeteries of words are strung in the souls, / what they will and hopes at Resurrection ... "". Here the words came back to poetry. But, the word is only the tool what not is only of the poet's, only of his, is the problem of background of existence illusory, perceived as such, in the existentialism terms from the early 21st century .This is the core, the leitmotif of dozens of poems signed by Sorin Cerin, distributed studied, I suppose symbolic numerological, in each volume 77 each, neither more or less.From the seed of this idea generously sown, rises for the poet tired of so much, kneaded thinking: ""Herbs of questions what float lazily over the eyelids / of the Sunset, / what barely can keep ajar, / in the horizon of some Answers, / what appear to be migrated toward the cold distances of the Forgetfulness. ""The note meditative of these lyrics is not entirely discouraging.The poet is neither depressed nor anxious, because he has a tonic temperament. He always goes from the beginning with undefeated statements the will, to understand, without accepting, as, thus, may to return toward the knowledge of self.In poetic images rare, is outlined a kind of summary of poetic discourse, focused in the poetry The Hierarchy of the Vanity, ended in contemporaneity terms of the absurd. It's a way to renew what was more said, that ""we eat absurd on bread."" The plural indicates in poet an exponent in the name of man in general, ""the granite"" signifying the mystery impenetrable, of which is now facing ""cane thoughtfully"" ""climbed up on the rocks of Life / we want to understand the granite as it is, / a reed conscious of self. || Demolish the pillars of Nature of the Illusion of Life, / trying to put in their place, / A Dream far stranger of ourselves. || ruined the Weakness , / ... becoming our own wrecks, / what wander to nowhere. || ... Would be the eyes of Consumer Society made only to/ watch the Hierarchy of the Vanities?Love that would deserve a comment of the nuances at which send the poetic images, is in the Dream and reality, an: "" icon attached to the walls of the cold and insensitive, / of a cathedral of licentiousness, as is the Consumer Society, / which us consumes the lives / for a Sens what we will not him know, never. ""Beyond the game of words, is noted, the noun seriously, what cancels altogether the sacredness of the cathedral.It's a transfer of meanings produced by the permanent revolt poured out upon the type of society we live in.Our life, the poet laments in the Feline Existential: ""is sells expensive at the counter of the Destiny / for to flavor the Debauchery, / subscriber with card of pleasures, all right / at the Consumer Society."" / ... ""Empty promises / and have lost keys of the Fulfillment / and now make, Moral to the cartel of Laws / alongside the prostitutes politicians, of the moment "".Violent language, as poetic arrows thrown and against terrible degradation of politics, gives free course to the ideas, a type nihilistic rebellion, raised to the rank of principle.Absolutely current target is even more evident when, in the poem, the Game of the Life with Death,, is criminalized in much the same terms, ""Consumer Society Famine garden, / as, great athletes, of cutting of incomes / hysterical and false, scales of the Policy, / us skimp sparingly each, Moment ... "".Changing the subject, vocable ""moment"" in relation to ""eternity"", updates a note from the arsenal of specific words from the language of the great existentialist thinker who was the mystic Kierkegaard.After how attitudes clearly atheist, when it comes to God and the church, in the poems of Cerin , update hardness of language, with particularities of existentialism of Sartre, while Mathematics of the existence and many other poem, us bring back into the cultural memory the image of that ""monde cassé"" perceived critical by the frenchman Gabriel Marcel.Perhaps the most dense in complementary concepts the ""existence"", between the first poems of the first volume, is Lewdness.Are attempts to give definitions, to put things in relationship through inversion with sense, again very serious accusatory, like the one with address at ""monastery"".Sure, unhappiness of the being that writes such poetry, comes not only from the consciousness of the fall of man in the world under the divine curse, but and from what would be a consequence, rejection, up to the blasphemy of the need for God.The interrogation, from the poetry, Lewdness, which, seems that leaves to the reader the freedom of to give particular answers, it's a trick of the poet aware of what affirms, at masked mode: ""The existence is a ghost caught between two dreams, Space and / Time./ Peace will always be indebted to the War with her own / weapons, Vanity of Democracy and Dictatorship ./ Which Lewdness has not its monastery and which murder /her democracy?""The poem continues with a new definition of ""Existence"" as a ""gamble"", accompanied by ""Hope"", never left at the mercy of ""free will"", which would give to man the freedom to change anything. It remains only the freedom of the being to judge her own existence, eternal fenced to can overcome the absurd. Nature demonstrative of the poet him condemns, extroversion, at excesses, that, scatters, too generous what has gathered hardly from the library of his own life and of books.Paradoxically, the same temperament is the source of power to live authentic feeling of alienation and accentuated loneliness, until to feel his soul as a ""house in ruins"", from which, gone, the being, fallen into ""Nothingness"", more has chance, of to be, doomed ""Eternity"".Remain many other comments of made at few words the poet's favorite, written with upper case.But, about, ""Love"", ""God"", ""Church,"" ""Absurd"", ""Moment and Eternity"", ""Silence"" and ""Death"" maybe another time.Would deserve, because this poet is not lacked of inspiration so coveted by others, as wrote poet Magda Cârneci, but he must beware of the danger of remaining an artifex, and yet not to step too pressed the footsteps from Bacovia or Emil Botta, toward of not them disfigure through excess. Ana Blandiana: ""The poetry of meditation on which a writes Sorin Cerin is not a versification of philosophical truths, but a interweaving of revelations, about these truths. And the ratio of intensity of these revelations and doubt from which are constructed the truths is precisely the philosopher's stone of this poetry. Moreover, secrecy of being able to fasten the lightning of the revelation is a problem as subtle as that of keeping solar energy from warm days into the ones cold. "" PhD Professor Theodor Codreanu: ""Sorin Cerin is a paradoxist aphoristic thinker, of, a great mobility of the mind, who controls masterfully the antitheses, joining them oxymoronically, or alternating them chiasmatic, in issues with major stakes from our spiritual and social life. Poetry from, the Free Will, is an extension of his manner of meditation, imbuing it with a suitable dose of kynism (within the meaning given to the word by Peter Sloterdijk), succeeding, simultaneously the performance, of to remain in the authentic lyricism even when blames ""Ravens vulgar, necrophiliacs and necrophagous, of the Dreams"". PhD Professor Ioan Holban : ""About the expressiveness and richness of meanings transmitted to the Other, by silence, Lucian Blaga wrote anthological pages. The poet of today writes, in Great Silences, a poetry of religious sentiment, not of pulpit, but, in thought with God, in meditation and in the streak of lightning of thought toward the moment of Creation. Sorin Cerin's poetry is of an other Cain wandering in the wilderness, keeping still fragments from the joy of Eden, to exit from ""Vise"" of the world, where, at the fallen man, collapses the horizon of soul, in the rains of fire and traces of lead. "" PhD Professor Maria Ana Tupan : ""The lyrical meditations of Sorin Cerin have something from the paradoxical mixture of despair and energy of the uprising from Emil Cioran's philosophical essays. The notification of tragicalness and grotesque of the existence, does not lead to psychical paralysis, but to nihilism exorcised and blasphemous. Quarrel with ""adulterine God"" - appellation shocking, but very expressive for the idea, of, original sin of ...

Not only, ingenious jumps deadly for the logic of identity from one ontological level to another, we admire here, but and tropism, of, a baroque inventiveness of an Eucharist inside out, because in a universe of the life toward death, the one that is broken is the spirit, the word, to reveal a flesh ... Deleuze, animal, described as the meticulous anatomical map of a medical student. The poet us surprise by novelty and revelation of the definition aphoristic, because after the first moment of surprise, we accept the moralizing scenery of the time, with a past, dead, a future alive, and a present, illusory, contrary to common sentiment, that the lived life is our ego certainly, that only the present really exists, and that the future is a pure hypothesis. Cerin, redefines the human being as, finding the authenticity in multiplication mental of ternal reality and as existentialist project "". PhD Professor Mircea Muthu: ""The desperation to find a Sens to the contemporary existence fill the poetic testimony of Sorin Cerin, in which the twilight of language, associated with ""broken hourglass"" of time, is, felt - with acuity tragic - of, ""our words tortured."" ""Meditation, turned towards self itself, of ""the mirrors of the question"" or of ""the eyes"" fabulous, of the Ocean endlessly, is macerated at the same temperature febrile, of voltaic arc, enunciated - in short - of the phrase ""rains of fire"". PhD Professor Cornel Ungureanu : ""Sorin Cerin proposes a poetic speech about how to pass "" beyond "", a reflection and a meditation that always needs capital letters. With capital letters, words can bear the accents pressed of the author who walks. with so much energy on the realms, beautiful crossed by those endowed with the grace of the priesthood. Sorin Cerin ritualization times of the poetic deconstruction, if is to we understand properly the unfolding of the lyrics under the flag of the title. "" PhD Professor Ion Vlad : ""Sorin Cerin has defined his poems from the book "" The Great Silences "", "" poems of meditation "". Undoubtedly, reflexivity is the dominant of his creation, chaired by interrogations, riots, unrest and dramatic research of SILENCE, topos of the doubts, of the audacity, and, of the adventure of the spirit, in the permanent search of the truth, and his poetry follows to an axiology of an intense dramatic.

Ph.D. Lecturer Laura Lazăr Zăvăleanu: ""Intellectual formed at the school Bucharest, but sensing the need to claim it admiringly, from the critical model, of the school Cluj, where he identify his exemplary models in the teachers, Ion Vlad and Mircea Muthu, Sorin Cerin builds and the poetry intertextual, because the poet of the Great Silences, declares all over, his experts, identified here, intrinsically, with Blaga ( through philosophical reflection and prosodic structure, sometimes deliberately modeled after Poems of light) and Arghezi. The very title of the volume, the Great Silences, impose the imperative, of an implicit dialogue with the poetry of Arghezi bearing the same title. At the searches feverish from the Psalms of Arghezi, of a God called to appear, answer them here the interpellations indefatigably of an apostate, believer, that is torn in the wilderness of the thought and of image broken mirrored by the world declared, between love denouncer, and affectionate revolt, between curse incantatory and disguised prayer, of eternally in love, without being able, to decline, in reality, fervor, although the word has experimented, aesthetic, the whole lexicon, blasphemously and apocalyptic. A duplicity of salvation, in fact, that - shouting the drama of alienation and of introspection missed, as and the impotence of the meeting with the other, or fear of overlapping with him, in a world whose meaning is wandered into ""darkness of the camps of ideas"", at the interference of a time and of a space reached ' at the end of border ""- gives birth, in the litany, `a rebours, the signs of creation redeemed, in full feast cynical, ""on the table of potter of love"". PhD Professor Călin Teutişan: ""Poetry of Sorin Cerin declaim a fatal nostalgia of the Sense.

Using of metaphors, neo-visionary, is context of reference of these poems, crossed, from time to time, of parables of the real, ""read"" in the key symbolic, but and ironical. Cynicism is entirely absent in the lyrics of Sorin Cerin. This means that the lyrical personage, what speaks in this pages, namely, consciousness lyrical, put an ethics pressure over reality, thus forcing her to assume own forgotten truths.

Between rationalism and irrationalism, Sorin Cerin sailing on the Interconnection Ocean. "" CRITICISM ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS The Coaxialism, book review by Henrieta Anisoara Serban, PhD in philosophy, Researcher, Institute of Political Science and International Relations of the Romanian Academy, written in 2007 : “This book represents an audacious contribution to contemporary philosophy. Not a mere synthesis, the volume brings to the fore a original vision concerning the truth (and the illusion), the absolut and the life, into the philosophical conversation of humanity. “What else are we, but a mad dream of an angel, taken up with himself, lost somewhere within the hierarcy of numerology?” (p.5), asks the author, triggering a captivating odyssey, with an opening towards the philosophy of conscience, contextualism and mind philosophy, that is relevant for the critique of the reprezentationalism and postmodernism. Coaxialism is structured in 11 chapters. They may be interpreted in triads. Therefore, the first three chapters could stand as an introduction to the thematic realm of coaxiology. The first chapter is concerned with “The purpose, the hirarchy, the birth of numerology and of the Primordial Factor ONE”, the second chapter treats “The Instinct, the Matrix, the Order and Disorder, the Dogma”, and the third chapter “The State of the fact, the Opened Knowledge and the Closed Knowledge, the Coaxialism and the Coaxiology”. Then, the next triad would be constituted by the interpretation of three aspects related to human exemplarity, via the chapters entitled “The Print and the Karmic Print, the Geniality”, “Love or the individual Conscience of the Human Being” and “Consciousness or the knowledge in Coaxiology”. And, the last triad, say, of a semantical and hermeneutical nature, approaches “Reflections on philosophy, the Alien within the Being, the Dimension of Life”, “The Semantical Coaxiology” and “The Semantical Truth, the Semantical Knowledge, the Semantical Mirror and the Reason of Creation”. The tenth chapter, named “Semantical Ontology, Neoontology, and Coaxiology, the Semantical Structuring of Our Matrix”, capitalizes on the ideas from the preceeding philosophical architecture. Eventually, the last chapter offers specific mathematical moddels of the ideas and concepts that are exposed within the book, along with the relationships among them. In a Schopenhauerian, Nietzschean and Wittgensteinian architectonics of the philosophical ideas, the author states the principles of what he labels as the “coaxialism”: 1. The only true philosophy is the one accepting that Man does neither know the Truth, and implicitly, nor philosophy, 2. Man shall never neither know the Absolute Truth nor the Absolute Knowledge, for his entire existence is based on the Illusion of Life, 3. Any philosophical system or philosopher pretending that he or she speaks the Truth is a liar, 4. The Coaxialism is, by excellence, a philosophy that does NOT pretend that it speaks the Truth, yet accepting certain applications sustaining the reference of the Illusion of Life to the Truth, 5. The Essence of the Truth consists in its reflection in the Elements appeared before it, as there are the elements of the Opened Knowledge deriving from the Current Situation, 6. The Coaxialism accepts the operations with the opposites of the opposites of the Existence, with or without a compulsory reference to such opposites, determining the coaxiology, 7. Each Antithetical has, to the Infinity, another Antithetical, which is identical to it, 8. The farther is an Antithetical situated, that is the more opposites are intercalated (between itself and its Antithetical), the more accentuated the similarities, and the less opposites are intercalated between the two Elements, the more accentuated the dissimilarities, 9. As well as we can conceive Universes without a corresponding substrate into the Existence, we can conceive Knowledge without a corresponding substrate into the essence, that is, without a subject, 10. The Factor is going to be always the opposite of the infinity to which it would relate as a finite quantity, the same way as the Knowledge relates to the lack of knowledge, and Life, to Death. Within a Coaxial perspective, the Factor shall be an equivalent to God, the Unique Creator, and yet Aleatory in relationship with its worlds 11. Within the Worlds of each Creator, unique and Aleatory Factor are to be reflected all the other Creators, all the unique and Aleatory Factors, as numbers, starting from ONE, that is the Primordial Factor, all the way to the Infinite minus ONE Factors of Creation, all Unique and Aleatory. (p.5-7) Certainly, someone may ask how is such a unitary cuantics going to be sustained? But to rise seriously such a question would mean to miss the point that here we have mathematical metaphors, suggestive models, and not a calculus leading to the Metaphysical Truth (which would at the same time contradict the very coaxiological principles). The bounty of capital letters and underlining in the text speak volumes of the American experience of the author, emphasising as well, with a certain irony, the endeavour to capture meaning, the thirst for absolute, for perfection, for the Truth and for the pure idea, central to all philosophies. Thus, given the following quote, I can at once offer exemplification for the above observation and clarify a column-idea of this intriguing work: “The Coaxiology is a philosophy capable of determining in depth the importance of the Factor (…) – which is also a number, I have to note, among other aspects it provided. It is produced by the Essence of an Element of the Matrix Status Quo, or by the Instinct. (…) The Factor is going to be the demiurge who, via his own capacity of consciousness should include in himself always new and newer Elements of the Closed Knowledge, also assessing, though, without knowing them into detail, Elements of the Opened Knowledge. (…) Man is such a Factor despite the fact that he is situated hierarchically much lower in comparison to the Great Creators.” (p.51-2) The author explains the coaxial (and eventually, structuralist) manner to investigate the world, as a paradoxical mix of good and evil, divine and demonic, humane and rational, a mix giving birth to the Illusion of Life and being sustained, grace of a feed-back, precisely by this Illusion of Life. (P.53 sq.) “Don’t you know that only in the lakes with muddy bottom the water-lily blossom?” was asking, the 20th century Romanian philosopher, Lucian Blaga, rhetorically, and already “coaxial”. The philosophical poetry of Mihai Eminescu is consecrated to the illusion of life. It reflects, as an illustration, in the poem “Floare albastr?” (“Blue Flower”, a Romantic motive, and yet, a coaxial motive, that appears within the German literature, at Novalis, or at Leopardi) the paradoxical marriage of the infinite with the wishes. This is a metaphor for the paradoxical marriage between the philosophical Knowledge, aiming at the absolute and the terrestrial Knowledge, through love, afflicting human’s heart, as a creative factor, stimulated by affection. As well as in his literature, Sorin Cerin accomplishes to express himself capitalizing at once the universal philosophy and on the great Romanian philosophical successes. For example, as she turns the pages of the book, the reader may have glimpses of Schopenhauer’s philosophy – let us recall that the human being, as a knowing subject, knows himself as a subject, endowed with a will and that he annot become pure subject of knowledge unless his will vanishes, in order to eliminate the reference to what one can wish in relationship with the knowledge, since the representation is maimed by desire ( The World as Will and Representation). The book sends to Nietzsche’s philosophy – see for instance the idea that “The apparent world is the only True one; the ‘real’ world is sheer lie”, from The Twilight of the Idols, ch. 3, aphorism 2. A more sensitive reader would find analogies with the philosophy of Emil Cioran, in The Trouble with Being Born. Coaxialism may recall Wittgenstein II in that philosophy represents the (re)organisation of what we have always known, while language is to be considered an “activity”, a “game” framed into certain “forms of life”, a summation of different phenomena, maybe related to one another, but in very different manners. As for the “Truth” one may associate the following suggestive line from the Philosophical Investigations, Oxford, 1953, 9, § 68: the strength of the thread does not rely in the fact that each fibre goes from end to end but in the overlapping of many fibres. At the same time, the idea of a creative factor “struggling” with the world to draw forth only partial and paradoxical Truths has from the very beginning strong echoes with the philosophy of mystery, as it appears within the work of Lucian Blaga. A similar analogy may be made with the figure of the “ironist” (proposed by Richard Rorty), at her turn, “struggling” with the world, in order to educate herself into the various vocabularies (read “parallel cultural realities”). The comparison with Blaga does not stop here, the researcher connoisseur identifying avenues of investigation towards the “Luciferic” versus “Paradisiac” Knowledge dichotomy, in analogy with the closed – opened Knowledge, with the Matrix, with the creative factor, etc. The work is also remarkable given its distinct literary qualities, the intriguing specific philosophical language developed in close relationship to the literary print, a distinguishing note for an interesting philosophical debut.” CRITICISM ABOUT WORKS OF APHORISMS One of the most prestigious and selective Romanian publishing house Eminescu in the Library of Philosophy published in autumn 2009 its entire sapiantial works including all volumes of aphorisms published before and other volumes that have not seen the light to that date, in Romanian language. Romanian academician Gheorghe Vladutescu,University Professor,D.Phil.,philosopher, one of the biggest romanian celebrity in the philosophy of culture and humanism believes about sapiential works of Sorin Cerin in Wisdom Collection:” Sapiential literature has a history perhaps as old writing itself.

One of the most reprezentative romanian literary critic, Ion Dodu Balan, University Professor, D.Lit. considered that Sorin Cerin "" Modern poet and prosiest, essays and philosophic study’s author on daring and ambitious themes like immortality, ephemerid and eternity, on death, naught, life, faith, spleen. Sorin Cerin has lately approached similar fundamental themes, in the genre of aphorisms, in the volumes: Revelations December 21, 2012, and Immortality. Creations that, through the language of literary theory, are part of the sapient creation, containing aphorisms, proverbs, maxims etc. which „sont les echos de l’experience”, that makes you wonder how such a young author can have such a vast and varied life experience, transfigured with talent in hundreds of copies on genre of wisdom.As to fairly appreciate the sapient literature in this two volumes of Sorin Cerin, I find it necessary to specify, at all pedantically and tutoring, that the sapient creation aphorism is related if not perfectly synonymous, in certain cases to the proverb, maxim, thinking, words with hidden meaning, as they are … in the Romanian Language and Literature. Standing in front of such a creation, we owe it to establish some hues, to give the genre her place in history. The so-called sapient genre knows a long tradition in the universal literature, since Homer up to Marc Aurelius, Rochefoucauld, Baltasar Gracian, Schopenhauer and many others, while in Romanian literature since the chroniclers of the XVII and XVIII century, to Anton Pann, C. Negruzzi, Eminescu, Iorga, Ibrăileanu, L.Blaga, and G.Călinescu up to C.V. Tudor in the present times.The great critic and literary historical, Eugen Lovinescu, once expressed his opinion and underlined “the sapient aphoristic character”, as one of the characteristics that creates the originality of Romanian literature, finding its explanation in the nature of the Romanian people, as lovers of peerless proverbs.Even if he has lived a time abroad, Sorin Cerin has carried, as he tells us through his aphorisms, his home country in his heart, as the illustrious poet Octavian Goga said, „ wherever we go we are home because in the end all roads meet inside us”.In Sorin Cerin’s aphorisms, we discover his own experience of a fragile soul and a lucid mind, but also the Weltanschauung of his people, expressed through a concentrated and dense form.Philosophical, social, psychological and moral observations.Sorin Cerin is a “moralist” with a contemporary thinking and sensibility. Some of his aphorisms, which are concentrated just like energy in an atom, are real poems in one single verse. Many of his gnomic formulations are the expression of an ever-searching mind, of a penetrating, equilibrated way of thinking, based on the pertinent observation of the human being and of life, but also of rich bookish information.Hus, he dears to define immortality as “moment’s eternity” and admits to “destiny’s freedom to admit his own death facing eternity”, “God’s moment of eternity which mirrors for eternity in Knowledge, thus becoming transient, thus Destiny which is the mirror imagine of immortality”.”Immortality is desolated only for those who do not love”, “immortality is the being’s play of light with Destiny, so both of them understand the importance of love”.Nevertheless, the gnomic, sapient literature is difficult to achieve, but Sorin Cerin has the resources to accomplish for the highest exigency. He has proved it in his ability to correlate The Absolute with Truth, Hope, Faith, Sin, Falsehood, Illusion, Vanity, Destiny, The Absurd, Happiness, etc.A good example of logic correlation of such notions and attributes of The Being and Existence, is offered by the Spleen aphorisms from the Revelations December 21, 2012 volume.Rich and varied in expression and content, the definitions, valued judgments on one of the most characteristics state of the Romanian soul, The Spleen, a notion hard to translate, as it is different from the Portuguese “saudode”, the Spanish “soledad”, the German “zeenzug”, the French “melancolie” and even the English “spleen”.Naturally, there is room for improving regarding this aspect, but what has been achieved until now is very good. Here are some examples which can be presumed to be „pars pro toto” for both of his books: „Through spleen we will always be slapped by the waves of Destiny which desire to separate immortality from the eternity of our tear”, „The spleen, is the one that throws aside an entire eternity for your eyes to be borne one day”, „The spleen is love’s freedom”, „The spleen is the fire that burns life as to prepare it for death”.(Fragments of the review published in the Literary Mirror (Oglinda Literara) no. 88, Napoca News March 26, 2009, Romanian North Star (Luceafarul Romanaesc), April 2009, and Literary Destinies (Destine Literare), Canada, April 2009)) Adrian Dinu Rachieru, University Professor, D.Lit. states:""...we may , of course, mention worth quoting, even memorable wordings. For example, Life is the ""epos of the soal"", future is defined as "" the father of death"".Finally, after leaving ""the world of dust"", we are entering the virtual space, into the ""eternity of the moment""(which was given to us)(Fragments of the review published in the Literary Mirror (Oglinda Literara) no.89 and the Romanian North Star (Luceafarul Romanesc), May 2009. Ion Pachia Tatomirescu,University Professor, D.Lit states:""a volume of aphorisms, Revelations - December 21, 2012, mainly paradoxes, saving themselves through a “rainbow” of thirty six “theme colors“ – his own rainbow – as a flag dangling in the sky, in the sight of the Being ( taking into account Platon’s acceptation on the collocation, from Phaedrus, 248-b), or from Her glimpsing edge, for the author, at the same time poet, novelist and sophist, “the father of coaxialism”, lirosoph, as Vl. Streinu would have named him (during the period of researching Lucian Blaga’s works), knows how to exercise thereupon catharsis on the horizon arch of the metaphorical knowledge from the complementarily of the old, eternal Field of Truth "" or of the sixth cover of the Revelation… volume, written by Sorin Cerin, we take notice of fundamental presentation signed by the poet and literary critic Al. Florin Ţene: «Sorin Cerin’s reflection are thinkings, aphorisms or apothegms, ordered by theme and alphabetically, having philosophical essence, on which the writer leans on like on a balcony placed above the world to see the immediate, through the field glass turned to himself, and with the help of wisdom to discover the vocation of distance. This book’s author’s meditation embraces reflections that open the way towards the philosophy’s deeps, expressed through a précis and beautiful style, which is unseparated from perfection and the power of interpreting the thought that he expresses. As a wise man once said, Philosophy exists where an object is neither a thing, nor an event, but an idea. ».The paradox condensing of Sorin Cerin’s aphorisms in a “rainbow” of thirty six “theme colors“– as I said above – tried to give the “sacred date” of 21 December 2012: the absolute («Human’s absolute is only his God»), the absurd («The absurd of the Creation is the World borne to die »), the truth («The Truth is the melted snow of Knowledge, from which the illusion of light will rise»), the recollection («The recollection is the tear of Destiny »), knowledge («Knowledge is limited to not have limits »), the word («The word is the fundament of the pace made by God with Himself, realizing it is the lack of nought: the spleen of nought»), destiny («Destiny is the trace left by God’s thought in our soul’s world »), vanity («Vanity revives only at the maternity of the dream of life »), Spleen («Within the spleen sits the entire essence of the world»), Supreme Divinity / God («God cannot be missing from the soul of the one who loves, as Love is God Itself »), existence («Existence feeds on death to give birth to life »), happiness («Happiness is the Fata Morgana of this world »), the being («The being and the non-being are the two ways known of God, from an infinite number of ways »), philosophy («Philosophy is the perfection of the beauty of the human spirit towards existence»), beauty («Beauty is the open gate towards the heaven’s graces»), thought («The thought has given birth to the world »), giftedness («Giftedness is the flower which grows only when sprinkled with the water of perfection») / genius («The genius understands that the world’s only beauty is love»), mistake («The mistake can never make a mistake»), chaos («Chaos is the meaning of the being towards the perfection of non-being»), illusion («The illusion is the essence of being oneself again in the nought»), infinity («Infinity is the guard of the entire existence»), instinct («The instinct is when the non-being senses the being »), love («Love is the only overture of fulfilling from the symphony of absurd»), light («Light is the great revelation of God towards Himself»), death («Death cannot die»), the eye / eyes («Behind the eyes the soul lie »), politics («The trash of humanity, finds his own place: they are rich!»), evilness («Evilness is the basis size of the humanity, in the name of good or love»), religion («Religion is indoctrinated hope»), Satan («Satan is the greatest way leader for mankind»), suicide («Society is the structure of collective suicide most often unconsciously or rarely consciously»), hope («Hope is the closest partner»), time (« Time receives death, making Destiny a recollection»), life («Life is the shipwreck of time on the land of death»), future of mankind and 21 December 2012 («Future is God’s agreement with life» / «Starting with 12 December 2012 you will realize that death is eternal life cleaned of the dirt of this world»), and the dream («he dream is the fulfilling of the non-sense »).(Fragments from the review published in The Forbidden Zone (Zona Interzisa) from August 30, 2009 and Nordlitera September 2009) CEIRTICAL

Illuminati Bible of Divine Light: Part one,['Sorin Cerin'],"With the appearance of my first philosophical studies but also of aphorisms, I initially published the book entitled Bible of the Light and then a more complete form of the book Bible of the Light was the book entitled The Illuminati Bible, so that in present to publish the full form of the Bible, which I felt that it will be perfected with the help of God, and which I decided to call the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light. Some will wonder why I chose this name of The Illuminati Bible starting with that book published in 2014, the content of which is also in this book called the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light which in turn contains many other parts? Simple. Firstly because I wanted to help, in Good, the Karma of this World, because Illuminati and Enlightenment are spoken of in negative terms, and secondly because Illuminati comes from Enlightenment, and true Enlightenment cannot bring the Evil, nor can it be the Evil, vile. True Enlightenment must be based only on Good and never on bringing the Evil as the supreme Wickedness. Therefore, in order to improve the Karma of Mankind, I show that Enlightenment does not consist in Wickedness but in combating Wickedness. The enlightened ones cannot be a hidden group of people who lead humanity out of the shadows committing all sorts of evils and abuses to maintain power.These people are by no means Enlightened but Dark. If there really are some in such a situation then they use the term Illuminati or Enlightened falsely. How, just as Dark are those who dirtyly attack on the true Illuminati or Enlightened only out of obscure interests of a religious nature, for fear that the Enlightened ones might open the souls of the People and show them the Way to the Truth from which some high prelates that are at the head of certain churches flee, who are afraid that, if the Truth would be found, they will lose both their financial and their decision-making power. I believe that the future will belong to those truly Enlightened, the true Illuminati. A thing is to use Evil to bring through it, Good and another is to use Evil to bring through it the Wickedness. The true Enlightened and not Dark are those who understand that the Evil can only be used for Good when he can do it, and the Good only for the Evil less Evil, when the Good itself can lead to destruction, disaster or pain. The real Bad People, the Dark Ones, are the ones who use both Good and Evil to do as much as possible Evil and not Good. Mankind must understand that the Evil and Good, the God and the Devil are an Entity with two distinct characteristics, an Entity that defines our True God, that is, our Creator Factor and Unique-Incidentally. Therefore, in order to improve the Karma of this World, we will have to pray to the Universal Consciousness formed by the Universal Pure Language.That is, to pray to the Divine Light of all the Worlds, the Supreme God of Intelligence, which to inspire our thoughts so that to use in moderation both Good and Evil, for the ultimate purpose of doing and bringing through us as much as possible Good. Why didn't I let in continuation the name of the Illuminati Bible and to this new, much deeper work of the Bible and call it the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light ? Because compared to the other book called the Illuminati Bible, the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light contains in addition to the content of that book many other new chapters that appeared with the new Wisdom Collections or with the final form of the Coaxialism.(Sorin Cerin)",542.0,['Philosophy'],5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B-Y-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-Y-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Action+%26+Adventure&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=409&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Illuminati Bible of Divine Light,['Sorin Cerin'],"The present book entitled the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light is a work of philosophy that deepens both ontological and gnoseological themes, regarding the Existence of God and implicitly ours. I have said many times, so far, that philosophy is the religion of the future.At the base of the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light is the philosophical-religious system called Coaxialism, published in its final form in the book entitled Coaxialism - Final Edition, but also the Collection of Wisdom consisting of 16,777 aphorisms structured according to certain themes, published in its final form in the book entitled, The Wisdom Collection: 16. 777 Philosophical Aphorisms- 2020 Edition. The God of the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light is not a dictatorial God who demands total submission from Man so that Man can benefit from a Paradise after Death, but is a God of Man's rediscovery in his own Self. The God of this World is the Creator Factor and Unique-Incidentally, who is defined through a Meaning that forms a Word. In the Parallel Universes there are an infinity of Creator Factors and Unique-Incidentally where each one in part is a Meaning that in turn determines a Word in the respective Universe, Word from which the respective Universe was formed, as well as our Universe in turn, was formed from the Word of our own Creator Factor and Unique -Incidentally. The totality of the Creator Factors and Unique-Incidentally, that is, the totality of the Meanings which determine, in their turn, each in part, a Word, form the Universal Pure Language, which in its totality determines the Consciousness Unique and Incidentally of the Universal Unique Expression which is the Supreme God, the Supreme Intelligence of all Universes whose number is infinite as is infinite and the number of the Words defined in turn, each in part, by the Creator Factors and Unique -Incidentally. The Unique-Incidentally Consciousness of the Universal Unique Expression always KNOWS where it is and what namely it does, each atom in part, each elementary particle in part, from each Universe which in turn together with all the other Universes makes up the infinity of Universes. I have always said that we are from before us, that is, we are a reflection of what was and from here comes the Destiny that cannot be changed, and the Free Will is an Illusion from the great range of the Illusions of Life. Everything that will Happen in our Future has Happened and has been in our Past before it was Time. Thus, the spiritual Energy of our Soul is allowed to pass through the Happenings that the Illusion of our own Life renders to us as being something new, even though they were, long before us. We are a quantum of energy, which flows through a reflection of the World that was before Time, a World through whose reflection we flow in the so-called Present, with our own spiritual energies of the Soul, having the false sensation of, Time, Past, Present and Future. From this flowing of ours, through the reflection of ​that World in the Mirror of Knowledge, we have the feeling that we are living our own Life even though in reality we are living our own Illusion of Life. In conclusion, we are only a quantum of energy which flows through the reflected images of the World that was somewhere - sometime, from before Time. As those images of the World in whose reflection we have the Illusion that we live cannot be changed, so neither our Destiny cannot be changed, because it flows once with the spiritual energies of our Souls, through the images of that World, which cannot be changed by us, because that World was before us. Thus, precisely the Illusion of Life that gives us the so-called Free Will, he which in reality does not exist, she, the Illusion of Life is the one that can help us to improve or worsen the spiritual energy of our Soul. Hence, results the necessity of the Illusion of Life in this World. Thus, once we travel through this World with Happenings that were long Before we believed that it Happens, accompanied by the Illusion of Life that makes us believe in the existence of Free Will, we go through, all sorts of Trials, that are the spiritual relief forms of this World, which is a reflection of what was, somewhere - sometime and from here comes the ineffable Destiny. Destiny is ineffable because it cannot be changed, because neither the World through whose reflection we pass can never be changed. Thus, the religions that have developed in this World, did not appear Incidentally, but they existed in the Initial World that was reflected in the Mirror of our Knowledge, a World that was, long Before us. In that World was also Jesus Christ, and the other Great Prophets such as the Prophet Muhammad, the Buddha, Moses, etc. What Happened on Earth, that is, in our World, was that some Souls who were so spiritually perfect had the approval of God, to travel through this World in the bodies of these Great Prophets, just as each of us have the acceptance of God, to travel through this World in our own bodies, which are some vehicles that take us from the destination of Birth to the destination of Death. These vehicles which are our bodies, they too, are, in turn, a reflection of a World that was long Before us. Due to these things, every Man is born under the specter of a certain Religion which has been left so by God through Destiny to Happen. The appearance of the Great Prophets was due to the Destiny. Jesus Christ, did not appear from Nothingness, Incidentally in our World, but was left namely to Happen in this way, by God, because God is the one who let the Mirror of Knowledge through which we to can become Aware of this World. That's exactly why every Man is good to follow the Religion existing in the area where he was born and to respect the Religions of other People born in other areas where there are other kinds of Religions, until these will be replaced or not, by other Religions, or philosophical and religious systems, with the Will of God, that is, on the understanding of some, in a natural way and not forced by anyone. Even Atheism is in itself a Religion, precisely through the fact that it is based on a certain Faith, where God is represented through the Laws of the Universe. It has been speculated about me that in the book The Evil I do not make a clear distinction between the Evil necessary for the existence of Good, and the Devil. Evil is necessary for the existence of Good just as Good is necessary for the existence of Evil. Evil can often be a far greater Good than Good and vice versa, Good can sometimes be a far greater Evil than Evil. Instead with what I do not agree and can really be considered an Evil that can be Devilish, is for example Wickedness. About wickedness, I have developed an entire chapter in the book entitled The Far Future of Mankind, Philosophical Aphorisms, the Chapter of Wickedness, aphorisms 1-227, a book which in turn is part of The Wisdom Collection : 16,777 Philosophical Aphorisms, which in turn is part from this book entitled The Illuminati Bible of Divine Light. Thus, Wickedness is something demonic which must be combated, because the Evil it brings does not serve the Good than in a much lesser extent, than the Good could serve, the Evil from this Wickedness. If we are to attribute Wickedness to the Devil, then we must certainly avoid him, as much as we can. In conclusion, Evil and Good are the attributes of God when Evil can help the Good and of the Devil when Evil can not help the Good than an even greater Evil. There is all sorts of speculation concerning the fact that I would have stated in Coaxialism that Man thinks only with a tiny percentage of the brain. ​I even said that Man does not think than with 2 percent from his brain. I stated this in the context in which I wanted to express that only a tiny percentage of the cognitive total we use would have any connection with the Absolute Truth through this interweaving of Illusions of the Life through which we travel during our own Life. In reality, I think that, that two percent percentage is very high and in reality it would not be, not even that much. And the brain in turn, is also an Illusion from the arsenal of the Illusions of Life, so the so-called ability of the human brain to process data is an Illusion as great, as our own Illusion of Life is. It is irrelevant whether or not Man uses his entire brain in the thought process once his entire thought process is subjected to the Illusion of Life and due to this fact the Man's thinking is not anchored by even two percent to the Absolute Truth. With the appearance of my first philosophical studies but also of aphorisms, I initially published the book entitled Bible of the Light and then a more complete form of the book Bible of the Light was the book entitled The Illuminati Bible, so that in present to publish the full form of the Bible, which I felt that it will be perfected with the help of God, and which I decided to call the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light. Some will wonder why I chose this name of The Illuminati Bible starting with that book published in 2014, the content of which is also in this book called the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light which in turn contains many other parts? Simple. Firstly because I wanted to help, in Good, the Karma of this World, because Illuminati and Enlightenment are spoken of in negative terms, and secondly because Illuminati comes from Enlightenment, and true Enlightenment cannot bring the Evil, nor can it be the Evil, vile. True Enlightenment must be based only on Good and never on bringing the Evil as the supreme Wickedness. Therefore, in order to improve the Karma of Mankind, I show that Enlightenment does not consist in Wickedness but in combating Wickedness. The enlightened ones cannot be a hidden group of people who lead humanity out of the shadows committing all sorts of evils and abuses to maintain power.These people are by no means Enlightened but Dark. If there really are some in such a situation then they use the term Illuminati or Enlightened falsely. How, just as Dark are those who dirtyly attack on the true Illuminati or Enlightened only out of obscure interests of a religious nature, for fear that the Enlightened ones might open the souls of the People and show them the Way to the Truth from which some high prelates that are at the head of certain churches flee, who are afraid that, if the Truth would be found, they will lose both their financial and their decision-making power. I believe that the future will belong to those truly Enlightened, the true Illuminati. A thing is to use Evil to bring through it, Good and another is to use Evil to bring through it the Wickedness. The true Enlightened and not Dark are those who understand that the Evil can only be used for Good when he can do it, and the Good only for the Evil less Evil, when the Good itself can lead to destruction, disaster or pain. The real Bad People, the Dark Ones, are the ones who use both Good and Evil to do as much as possible Evil and not Good. Mankind must understand that the Evil and Good, the God and the Devil are an Entity with two distinct characteristics, an Entity that defines our True God, that is, our Creator Factor and Unique-Incidentally. Therefore, in order to improve the Karma of this World, we will have to pray to the Universal Consciousness formed by the Universal Pure Language.That is, to pray to the Divine Light of all the Worlds, the Supreme God of Intelligence, which to inspire our thoughts so that to use in moderation both Good and Evil, for the ultimate purpose of doing and bringing through us as much as possible Good. Why didn't I let in continuation the name of the Illuminati Bible and to this new, much deeper work of the Bible and call it the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light ? Because compared to the other book called the Illuminati Bible, the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light contains in addition to the content of that book many other new chapters that appeared with the new Wisdom Collections or with the final form of the Coaxialism. In the last edition of the Wisdom Collection, I published six other new books of philosophical aphorisms, bringing the Collection of Wisdom to a total of 16,777 philosophical aphorisms. The last books refer to topics such as those related, to Justice, to the World after Death, to the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence, to the far Future of Mankind, etc. All this highlights not only a Bible with concepts like the one I called the Illuminati Bible but also one that fully reflects my thinking and faith as a whole, which is based on my philosophical-religious system called Coaxialism, and therefore, the book could not be called otherwise than the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light. Especially since in this book, entitled the Illuminati Bible of Divine Light, there is also the final form of my philosophical-religious system called Coaxialism, where I refer to Transcendental Coaxiological Mathematics but also to Mathematical Psychology. I am convinced that philosophy, Coaxialism, will become part of the Religion of the Future, a Religion whose churches will be the souls of the People. Yes, I want that the soul of every Man to be a Temple of worship, Enlightened by the Divine Light of Absolute Truth, whose Thought is reflected by the Universal Consciousness of the Universal Pure Language. A Language whose Words are infinite, and of all these Words, one of them is our God, that is, our Creator Factor and Unique-Incidentally, who gave birth to this World.

Although some of these objections come from unbelievers, several are from professing Christians who have been critical of the consistently God-centered system of theology, philosophy, and apologetics in Scripture. The objections from professing believers against the Christian faith exhibit patterns of reasoning that are remarkably similar to those found in unbelievers, including some of the intellectual habits and assumptions that underlie atheism. In connection with this, several of the articles examine some of the most treasured and ingrained doctrines that professing believers have invented in order to subvert the teachings of Scripture. They show that these traditional doctrines are not only unbiblical, but often even blasphemous.",,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fGu5BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fGu5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=79&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fGu5BQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-fGu5BQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Mystery of Edwin Drood,['Charles Dickens'],"The biggest mystery of The Mystery of Edwin Drood is how it ends. It began as a serial, as nearly all of Dickens' novels did, but only six installments were published before the author's death in 1870. What we know about Edwin Drood is this: he is betrothed to a young woman named Rosa Bud; they are fond of each other, but uncertain about their future together. Jasper John--Edwin's older uncle and a frequenter of London's opium dens--is infatuated with Rosa, as is Neville Landless, and the two begin to compete for her affection behind the scenes. Then, on Christmas Eve, Drood disappears, leaving behind only a pin and a pocket watch. What became of Edwin Drood that fateful night is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in literature and it continues to intrigue readers, writers, and literary historians more than 100 years after Dickens' death.

Initiation into the Mysteries of the Ancient World,['Jan N. Bremmer'],"The ancient Mysteries have long attracted the interest of scholars, an interest that goes back at least to the time of the Reformation. After a period of interest around the turn of the twentieth century, recent decades have seen an important study of Walter Burkert (1987). Yet his thematic approach makes it hard to see how the actual initiation into the Mysteries took place. To do precisely that is the aim of this book. It gives a ‘thick description’ of the major Mysteries, not only of the famous Eleusinian Mysteries, but also those located at the interface of Greece and Anatolia: the Mysteries of Samothrace, Imbros and Lemnos as well as those of the Corybants. It then proceeds to look at the Orphic-Bacchic Mysteries, which have become increasingly better understood due to the many discoveries of new texts in the recent times. Having looked at classical Greece we move on to the Roman Empire, where we study not only the lesser Mysteries, which we know especially from Pausanias, but also the new ones of Isis and Mithras. We conclude our book with a discussion of the possible influence of the Mysteries on emerging Christianity. Its detailed references and up-to-date bibliography will make this book indispensable for any scholar interested in the Mysteries and ancient religion, but also for those scholars who work on initiation or esoteric rituals, which were often inspired by the ancient Mysteries.",274.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2zyCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N2zyCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=156&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N2zyCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-N2zyCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Mysterious Plus,['William Tarvin'],"The Mysterious Plus opens with a situation recently in the news: the murder of an American embassy official in a North African country. The aim of the novel, however, is broader than an individual act of violence. Its murder becomes a symbol of the fanatic-inflamed divisions between Muslim Middle East and Judeo-Christian West, which are fraying the ties that bond humanity. The hero of The Mysterious Plus straddles both worlds. To save his sister, Omar Naaman, nineteen, betrayed comrades and country during Algeria’s fight for independence from colonial rule. At the war’s end, the defeated French, grateful for his double-dealing service, whisked him to France, bestowing a new identity, Remy Montpellier. Years later, Remy is coerced by the French DGSE (their intelligence service) to return incognito to Algeria, where as Omar he is still branded as a traitor, in fact, as the last of the “Seven Devils,” the first six “great collaborators” having been tracked down and killed by Algerian agents. Sent to investigate the gay-bashing murder of an American embassy attaché, who (DGSE suspected) was trafficking classified documents, Remy gradually moves from pursuer to pursued. Will he fulfill the true purpose of his returning to Algiers, or will his treasonous past overtake him? How does the “Mysterious Plus” control the answers to these two questions and hence the resolution to the novel? In his previous book, The Saint of Sodomy (GLB, 1999), William Tarvin, who lived in the Middle East for two decades, satirized Muslim sexual hypocrisies. Though the same barbed wit infuses The Mysterious Plus, it is counterpoised by a darker strain, that materialistic/spiritual differences between West and Middle East threaten to sever the cords bonding humanity. Addendum: Since the novel incorporates ideas from around one thousand philosophical, religious, literary, social, psychological, historical, and political works, Tarvin has provided some commentary and definitions in end-of-chapter footnotes.",368.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CtaPBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CtaPBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=207&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CtaPBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CtaPBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Timbuctoo the Mysterious,['Félix Dubois'],"Special Envoy of Figaro, Felix Dubois, left Dakar in 1896 and traveled into Mali by train to the end of the line (just after Kayes), and then on foot and horseback to Bamako and in pinnace from Koulikoro to Timbuktu. He describes Bamako, Segou but extremely long Djenne and Timbuktu, focusing on economic and cultural activities, collecting manuscripts and bringing a unique iconography (including photos of Fort Segou, a plan and reconstruction of the old mosque Jenne already been lost and not rebuilt); fundamental evidence on Mali in the early hours of colonization. Dubois resumed (from North) this journey of 15 years later and thus engaged in an assessment of changes. The merit of Felix Jones is to have transcribed the path to that goal, in a masterly text drawn from the sources of the bush, heat and space. His style made great reporter of the late nineteenth century, teeming with anecdotes.

Finishing the Mysteries of Gods and Symbols,['Seven Star Hand'],"Here is comprehensive proof that the symbolism of many ancient texts, canons, and concepts is an advanced and extremely ancient spiritual and philosophical technology that predates all extant religions and mystery schools. Consequently, here is proof, beyond disproof, that all three so-called “Faiths of Abraham” are purposeful deceptions. Accordingly, related esoterica, mystery schools, and the New Age are rife with error caused by undue reliance upon the assertions of these religions and their leaders. Throughout this book, I present verifiable proof that ancient sages and prophets opposed religion and wisely never trusted religious leaders. As comprehensive validation of this, they redundantly encoded stunning proof of why throughout pivotal symbolic narratives and related concepts. The ancient sages and prophets hid vital secrets from religious leaders throughout the previous several millennia. When these decoded details are compared to the history, words, and deeds of these religions and their leaders, they finally prove the truth about many long-hidden things. These religions have always purposely imposed ignorance based on the deceptive recasting of earlier symbolic concepts and narratives; that also expertly encoded the keys to ancient wisdom as redundant proofs of the truth. Arrogant religious leaders, while hypocritically lecturing others about morality, have long overlooked that the ancient sages and prophets were painfully aware of their then-current and future misdeeds and deceptions, and patiently and expertly prepared for them !!!",,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7plAC9eMBJ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7plAC9eMBJ4C&pg=PP1&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=305&source=gbs_api,Volume 0,No link available

Madame Blavatsky on the history and tribulations of the Zohar,['Helena Petrovna Blavatsky'],"The European Occultists see in the Jewish Kabbalah alone the universal well of wisdom and find in it the secret lore of nearly all the mysteries of Nature. For them the Zohar is an Esoteric Thesaurus of all the mysteries of the Christian Gospel. The Esoteric language used by the Alchemists was their own, given out as a blind necessitated by the dangers of the epoch they lived in, and not as the Mystery-language, as used by the Pagan Initiates, which the Alchemists had re-translated and re-veiled once more. Some believe that the substance of the Kabbalah is the basis upon which Masonry is built, since modern Masonry is undeniably the dim and hazy reflection of primeval Occult Masonry, of the teaching of those divine Masons who established the Mysteries of the prehistoric and prediluvian Temples of Initiation. Others maintain that the numerical language of the Kabbalistic works teaches universal truths, and not any one Religion in particular. Those who make this statement are perfectly right in saying that the Mystery-language used in the Zohar and in other Kabbalistic literature was once the universal language of Humanity. But they become entirely wrong if to this fact they add the untenable theory that this language was invented by, or was the original property of, the Hebrews, from whom all the other nations allegedly borrowed it. The writings which pass today under the title of the Zohar of Rabbi Shimon are not authentic. Moreover, the lore found in Kabbalistic literature was never recorded in writing before the first century of the modern era. There was at all times a Kabbalistic literature among the Jews, though historically it can be traced only from the time of the Captivity. Yet, from the Pentateuch down to the Talmud, the documents of that literature were ever written in a kind of Mystery-language, a series of symbolical records which the Jews had copied from the Egyptian and the Chaldæan Sanctuaries, only adapting them to their own national history. Jews and Christians rely on a phonograph of a dead and almost unknown language. There are scholars who do not carry the now-known Hebrew square letters beyond the late period of the fourth century. The real Hebrew of Moses was lost after the seventy years’ captivity and ceased from that time to be a spoken language. The Lost Tribes of Israel is a pure invention of the Rabbis. Not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all; and Herodotus was born in B.C. It is now becoming apparent that the Kabbalah of the Jews is but the distorted echo of the Secret Doctrine of the Chaldæans, and that the real Kabbalah is found only in the Chaldæan Book of Numbers, now in the possession of certain Persian Sufis. Hebrew cannot be called an old language, merely because Adam is supposed to have used it in the Garden of Eden. Linguistic analysis shows that the old Egyptian tongue was only old Hebrew and that the two nations lived together for centuries. Before adopting the Chaldæan for their phonetic tongue, the Jews had already adopted the old Coptic or Egyptian. The Hebrew Scriptures had been tampered with and remodelled, had been lost and rewritten, a dozen times before the days of Ezra. In its hidden meaning, from Genesis to the last word of Deuteronomy, the Pentateuch is the symbolical narrative of the sexes, and an apotheosis of Phallicism under astronomical and physiological personations. The wise King of Israel who succeeded his father, King David, was noticed neither by Herodotus, nor by Plato, nor by Diodorus Siculus, nor by any writer of standing. The Bible as it is now (i.e., the Hebrew texts), depends for its accuracy on the authenticity of the Septuagint, written miraculously by the “Seventy” in Greek, and the original copy having been lost since, our texts have been re-translated backward into Hebrew. So little, indeed, was Hebrew known that both the Septuagint and the New Testament had to be written in Greek, a heathen language, and no better reasons for it given than that “the Holy Ghost chose to write the New Testament in Greek.” The new system of the Masoretic points has made the Hebrew characters a sphinx-like riddle for all. Punctuation is now to be found everywhere, in all later manuscripts, and by means of it anything can be made of a text; a Hebrew scholar can put on the texts any interpretation he likes. The Tower of Babel myth relates to enforced secrecy. Men falling into sin were regarded as no longer trustworthy for the reception of such esoteric knowledge and, from being universal, it became limited to the few. One of the chief Lords or Hierophants of the Mysteries of Yava-Aleim had confounded the languages of the earth, so that the sinners could understand one another’s speech no longer. There are two distinct styles, two antagonistic schools, plainly traceable in the Hebrew Scriptures — the Elohistic and the Jehovistic. The one taught strictly esoteric doctrines, the other theological doctrines. The Elohists identified their Deity, as in the Secret Doctrine, with Nature. The Jehovists made of Jehovah a personal God and used the term simply as a phallic symbol. The original Mosaic text have been tampered with and replaced by that of the later Levites, who practiced degenerate mysteries and veiled Pantheism under Monotheism. The Ain-Soph of the Chaldæans, and later of the Jews, is a copy of the Vedic Deity; while the “Heavenly Adam,” the Macrocosm which unites in itself the totality of beings and is the Spirit of the visible universe, finds his original in the Puranic Brahmā. The Zohar places Ain-Soph, or Absolute Unity, outside human thought and appreciation; and in the Sepher Yetzirah the Spirit of God (Logos, not the Deity itself) is called The One. The true meaning of the compound name of Jehovah (of which, unvowelled, you can make almost anything) is men and women, or humanity composed of two sexes. A Kabbalist traces Jehovah from the Adam of earth to Seth, the third “son,” or rather race, of Adam. Thus Seth is Jehovah male; and Enos, being a permutation of Cain and Abel, is Jehovah male and female, or mankind. Eve stands as the evolution and the never-ceasing “becoming” of Nature. If we call Jehovah by his divine name, then he becomes at best and forthwith “a female passive” potency in Chaos. And if we view him as a male God, he is no more than one of many angels. There are four Adams, one for each of the preceding Root-Races. Thus the Kabbalah, as we have it now, is of the greatest importance in explaining the allegories and “dark sayings” of the Bible. As an Esoteric work upon the mysteries of creation, however, it is almost worthless as it is now disfigured — unless cross-checked by the Chaldæan Book of Numbers or by the tenets of the Eastern Secret Science. We have shown that the “Hebrew Bible” exists no more and hat uninitiated have to content with the garbled accounts and falsified copies of the real Mosaic Bible of the Initiates. The Temple of King Solomon exists to this day as a stupendous living monument of Esoteric records, while the famous temple has never existed outside of the far later Hebrew scrolls. The letters in the Hebrew sacred scrolls are musical notes. In the Sanskrit language letters are continually arranged in the sacred ollas so that they may become musical notes. Thus the Devanagari are the speech of the Gods, and Sanskrit, is the divine language. Sanskrit is the perfect form of the most perfect language on earth; Hebrew, the roughest and the poorest. The six days of the week and the seventh, the Sabbath, are based primarily on the seven creations of the Hindu Brahmā, the seventh being that of man; and, secondarily, on the number of generation. The Sabbath is pre-eminently and most conspicuously phallic. The mystery of the woman, who was made from the man, is repeated in every national religion, and in Scriptures far antedating the Jewish. Genesis does not begin at the beginning. Neither the septiform chronology nor the septiform theogony and evolution of all things is of divine origin in the Bible. The Jews never had more than three keys out of the seven in mind, while composing their national allegories — the astronomical, the numerical, and above all the purely anthropological, or rather physiological key. This resulted in the most phallic religion of all, and has now passed, part and parcel, into Christian theology.",44.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ogKwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ogKwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=378&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ogKwDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ogKwDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Return of the Feminine and the World Soul,['Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee'],"The feminine holds the mystery of creation. This simple and primordial truth is often overlooked, but at this time of global crisis, which also carries the seeds of a global transformation, we need to reawaken to the spiritual power and potential of the feminine. Feminine qualities belong to both men and women, and they draw us into the depths within us, into the mysteries of the soul whose wisdom is called Sophia. Without the feminine nothing new can be born, nothing new can come into existence—we will remain caught in the materialistic images of life that are polluting our planet and desecrating our souls. We need to return to the core of our being, to where the sacred comes into existence. And the mystical feminine holds the key to this work of redemption and transformation. Over the past two decades Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee has given different teachings on the feminine and the anima mundi, the World Soul. They are compiled here for the first time. “Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee presents us with a clear picture of the Feminine which is now essential to building a new vision and value for our dear planet earth.” —MARION WOODMAN, Ph.D., Jungian Analyst and author “This book is the work of an alchemist—a vitally important contribution to the Great Work of rescuing the human soul from the darkness that currently shrouds it. In this dangerous transitional time, where ignorance, confusion and cruelty abound, its theme of the need for us to recover and comprehend the Feminine is of absolute and urgent relevance. Few people are able to define and evoke the Feminine in the way that Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee does; in poetic and beautiful prose, he speaks directly from his soul to ours, acting as advocate for the longing of the anima mundi, the World Soul, to be welcomed once again into our lives and our culture. He knows that this is the time of humanity’s awakening: each one of us participates in the mystery of the light hidden within us and within all nature that is being awakened. For exploring this mystery so directly and deeply and with such insight, he deserves our deepest gratitude. Women and men alike will welcome and treasure this book.” —ANNE BARING, co-author, The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image and The Dream of the Cosmos: A Quest for the Soul",271.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kxECCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kxECCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=403&source=gbs_api,,No link available

And since this Catechism proposes as its primary object to answer the question, for what purpose are we here upon earth, thereby emphasizing and giving prominence to man's high calling and destiny, it is especially suited to the present day, when the pursuit of material interests, self-indulgence and pleasure, engrosses the attention of so many.

Mystic Masonry,['Jirah Dewey Buck'],"J. D. Buck explains and demystifies Freemasonry in this illustrated account of the secret society, their ritual practices and use of symbols to communicate their ideas. The author speaks in favor of the ethical principles and ideas of the Masons; their insistence upon moral rectitude and good behavior of its members supports the idea that Masonry aims to cultivate the highest virtues of humankind. Such preservation of humanity's greatest strengths is to be applauded: writing in the early 20th century, the author muses on the social and economic upheavals in a world that has rapidly changed amid industrialization. Addressing public curiosity on the links between Freemasonry and the ancient lore of the occult is one of Buck's primary aims. The various ancient mysteries dating back to the time when Egypt was under the rule of the Pharaohs are examined. We discover how the modern Masonic principles of liberty, equality and fraternity relate and reconcile with the symbology present in the lodges around the world. Together with Masonic texts, the author also spoke with Masons and conducted research into ancient civilizations.

Geography Education Promoting Sustainability,['Eila Jeronen'],"Through out the current period of educational change, Geography education has also changed. The innovations may be the starting point to affect conceptual change and paradigm shifts. Geography education assimilates and integrates knowledge, skills and scientific methodologies. The ten articles in this book illuminate a wide range of topics of interest to Geography education. In their article, Skarstein and Wolff discuss how the interplay between the environment, society and economy pillars of sustainability thinking play out on scales of time, space and multitude and how geography teachers can support the students’ understanding of sustainability. Yli-Panula et al. analysed used teaching and learning methods to find out good ones for promoting sustainability in geography. The same idea can be found in Duffin's and Perry’s article on Place-Based Ecology Education. In their article, Dür and Keller discuss the topics of quality of life, sustainability and global justice based on the goals of Education for Sustainable Development. Evaluation is an important part of learning. It is reviewed by Schauss and Sprenger regarding climate change education. The following two articles deal with students' views of landscapes worth conserving. In both studies, students expressed concern about the state of the environment. Yli-Panula et al. found that the Mexican students seldom considered their own activities in relation to the environment while Yli-Panula et al. stated that only some of the Finnish and Swedish students act as observers while others actively care for their environment. The remaining three articles deal with teaching methods and models. Benninghaus et al. present a benchmark method, which allows statements about the quality of the maps/diagrams in general.

Worship of Planetary Spirits is idolatrous Astrolatry,['Helena Petrovna Blavatsky'],"Divine Astrology is for Initiates; superstitious Astrolatry for the masses. The Occultist’s reverence for Planetary Spirits is not worship as the word is commonly under-stood. For the Theosophists, planetary “angels” occupy no higher place than that which Virgil assigns them. Each and all are occult potencies having sway over certain attributes of nature. Worship of Planetary Spirits is idolatrous Astrolatry. The Church is not against magic proper, but only against those magicians who fail to conform to her methods and rules of evocation. Worship of the “Seven Spirits” by the Church has been legal in all the ages. No truth, upon any subject whatever, has been ever made complete by the Church. Otherwise, where would be the mystery so absolutely necessary to the authority of her incomprehensible dogmas? The Seven Sabian Gods, and the Seven Seats and Virtues of the Kabbalists have become with the Catholics their “Seven Eyes of the Lord,” and the “Seven Thrones,” instead of Seven Seats. The “miracles” performed in the bosom of Mother Church, from the apostolic down to the ecclesiastical miracles at Lourdes, are pernicious in their result upon the human mind. While the Church feared to adopt even the Chaldean substitutes for the “mystery-names,” as they had been so “desecrated by magical practices,” it embraced other “mystery-names,” far less known than their substitutes have ever been. A terrible epidemic of obsession and possession broke out in 1553, when almost all Rome found itself possessed by the devil. The worship of “mystery names” under various substitutes continues to this day. The Jesuits rejoiced the most at the resurrection of the old worship, in view of the prodigious help they received from it. Church services in honour of the seven “Spirit-Stars” have never been abrogated since. Bolstered by the courage of true believers, the Christian defenders of the Seven Star-Angels deny nothing and keep silent whenever accused of rendering divine honours to Chaldean and other gods. Every planet is septenary, like man. The visible planet is the physical body of the sidereal being, the Atma or Spirit of which is the Angel, or Rishi, or Dhyani-Chohan, or Deva, etc. This is the tenet of the Secret Doctrine — minus its idolatrous element. As taught in the Church and her rituals, however, and especially, as practised, Angel-Worship is Astrolatry pure and simple. The Great Pyramid was erected as an observatory of Occult Astrognosy, at time when Draconis, the then Polar Star, was at its lower culmination and the Pleiades were on the same meridian above. Retrograding minds, while unable to follow their forefather’s grand ideas, were yet anxious to prove that they knew as much and far more. Having reviled Astrolatry, and trampled under their feet the sacred bulls Apis and Mnevis, they then instituted a Pastoral Religion in which, instead of the sacred Bull, they worshipped a Lamb. They allowed all the heathen names of Stars named by their idolatrous forefathers to remain status quo, and, at the same time, perverted their meanings in the most cunning way. Plagiarising, Christianising, and degrading Pagan Astronomy — wild beasts in scarlet clothing. Respect the Spirits but keep them at arm’s length.",21.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hGkiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hGkiEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Mystery&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=480&source=gbs_api,Divine Astrology is for Initiates; superstitious Astrolatry for the masses.,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hGkiEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hGkiEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Asteroid Answers to Ancient Calendar Mysteries,['Herbert R. Stollorz'],"Ancient calendars found around the world are designed to end one point in time. They communicate an urgent warning to everyone alive today! Complex bronze and gold clocks with multiple dials are found in museums around the world. Why they have such advanced intricacy has stumped scientists for hundreds of years.This book reveals why the ancients built so many pyramids, observatories as well as those complex gold and bronze clocks with more than one dial. It surprised me greatly to discover that their various complex designs in one way or another converge on 21 December 2012. It amazes me that ancient cultures separated by thousands of miles of geography and thousands of years in chronology agree so precisely in the cyclical nature of time, history and prophecy, which is history written in advance. The most famous example is the Mayan-Aztec calendar, which ends its 25,626-year cycle on that momentous date. Some researchers have also found 21 December 2012 in what is called, the Bible Code. Using very different research methods, I discovered it in the Bible's book of Revelation and Daniel's prophecies.

"Wonder, Horror, Mystery","['Morgan Meis', 'Joshua M. Tyree']","Wonder, Horror, Mystery is a dialogue between two friends, both notable arts critics, that takes the form of a series of letters about movies and religion. One of the friends, J.M. Tyree, is a film critic, creative writer, and agnostic, while the other, Morgan Meis, is a philosophy PhD, art critic, and practicing Catholic. The question of cinema is raised here in a spirit of friendly friction that binds the personal with the critical and the spiritual. What is film? What's it for? What does it do? Why do we so intensely love or hate films that dare to broach the subjects of the divine and the diabolical? These questions stimulate further thoughts about life, meaning, philosophy, absurdity, friendship, tragedy, humor, death, and God. The letters focus on three filmmakers who challenged secular assumptions in the late 20th century and early 21st century through various modes of cinematic re-enchantment: Terrence Malick, Lars von Trier, and Krzysztof Kieślowski. The book works backwards in time, giving intensive analysis to Malick's To The Wonder (2012), Von Trier's Antichrist (2009), and Kieślowski's Dekalog (1988), respectively, in each of the book's three sections. Meis and Tyree discuss the filmmakers and films as well as related ideas about philosophy, theology, and film theory in an accessible but illuminating way. The discussion ranges from the shamelessly intellectual to the embarrassingly personal. Spoiler alert: No conclusions are reached either about God or the movies. Nonetheless, it is a fun ride.",371.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ngWVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA140&dq=Horror&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=6&source=gbs_api,"Letters on Cinema and Religion in Malick, Von Trier, and Kieslowski",No link available

Escape Philosophy,['Roy Christopher'],"We are all perpetually holding ourselves together. Our breath, our blood, our food, our spit, our shit, our thoughts, our attention-all tightly held, all the time. Then at death we let it all out, oozing at once into the earth and gasping at last into the ether. The physical body has often been seen as a prison, as something to be escaped by any means necessary: technology, mechanization, drugs and sensory deprivation, alien abduction, Rapture, or even death and extinction. Taking in horror movies from David Cronenberg and UFO encounters, metal bands such as Godflesh, ketamine experiments, AI, and cybernetics, Escape Philosophy is an exploration of the ways that human beings have sought to make this escape, to transcend the limits of the human body, to find a way out. As the physical world continues to crumble at an ever-accelerating rate, and we are faced with a particularly 21st-century kind of dread and dehumanization in the face of climate collapse and a global pandemic, Escape Philosophy asks what this escape from our bodies might look like, and if it is even possible. Roy Christopher is an aging BMX and skateboarding zine kid. That's where he learned to turn events and interviews into pages with staples. He has since written about music, media, and culture for everything from self-published zines and personal blogs to national magazines and academic journals.

Non-identity Theodicy,['Vince R. Vitale'],"This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Questions as personal as those about suffering require a very personal response. However, the most popular responses to the problem of evil revolve around abstract discussions of greater goods, maximization of value, and best possible worlds, depicting God as at best an impartial bureaucrat and at worst a utility fanatic, rather than as a loving parent concerned first and foremost for his children. Vince R. Vitale develops Non-Identity Theodicy as an original response to the problem of evil. He begins by recognizing that horrendous evils pose distinctive challenges for belief in God. The book constructs an ethical framework for theodicy by sketching four cases of human action where horrendous evils are either caused, permitted, or risked, either for pure benefit or for harm avoidance. This framework is then brought to bear on the project of theodicy. The initial conclusions drawn impugn the dominant structural approach of depicting God as causing or permitting horrors in individual lives for the sake of some merely pure benefit. This approach is insensitive to relevant asymmetries in the justificatory demands made by horrendous and non-horrendous evil and in the justificatory work done by averting harm and bestowing pure benefit. Vitale then critiques theodicies that depict God as permitting or risking horrors in order to avert greater harm. The second half of this book develops a theodicy that falls outside of the proposed taxonomy. Non-Identity Theodicy suggests that God allows evil because it is a necessary condition of creating individual people whom he desires to love. This approach to theodicy is unique because the justifying good recommended is neither harm-aversion nor pure benefit. It is not a good that betters the lives of individual human persons--for they would not exist otherwise, but it is the individual human persons themselves.",273.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=weMJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=weMJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Horror&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=313&source=gbs_api,A Grace-based Response to the Problem of Evil,No link available

While Mary is essentially a vegetable, Dr. Raymond goes into hiding in London to escape his horrible mistake.

A senior civil servant meets his “Curious Death by Duty and Logic” when he obediently runs a massage parlour to raise the Total Fertility Rate of Singapore.

Bill was the top salesman of his company that year and was awarded a weekend trip at any four star hotel of his choice compliments of the company he works for. Bill and Karen packed their belongings and said goodbye to their children and headed to the airport to their destination. As their plane took off to the blue skies Karen said "" Bill you sure are deserving of this trip and I'm so happy to be sharing this moment with you.""

Transgressions of Reading,['Robert D. Newman'],"It is often claimed that we know ourselves and the world through narratives. In this book, Robert D. Newman portrays narrative engagement as a process grounded in psychoanalytic theory to explain how readers (or listeners or viewers) manage to engage with specific narratives and derive from them a personal experience. Newman describes this psychodrama of narrative engagement as that of exile and return, an experience in which narrative becomes a type of homeland, beckoning and elusive, endlessly defining and disrupting the borders of a reader's identity. Within this paradigm, he considers a fascinating variety of narrative texts: from the Jim Jones episode in Guyana to Freud's repression of personal history in his story of Moses; from a surrealistic collage novel by Max Ernst to the horror films of Alfred Hitchcock; from the works of James Joyce, Ariel Dorfman, Milan Kundera, and D. M. Thomas to the tales of abjection in pornography. Transgressions of Reading is itself an engaging work, as interesting for its provocative readings of particular works as for its theoretical insights. It will appeal to readers from all fields in which narrative plays a crucial role, in the study of film and art, modern and contemporary literature, popular culture, and feminist, psychoanalytic, and reader response theory.",200.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r-YkAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=r-YkAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Horror&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=332&source=gbs_api,Narrative Engagement as Exile and Return,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r-YkAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-r-YkAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

As the saying goes what goes around, comes around. That is exactly what happened to Sir Jacob Edwards. After forty years of snapping prisoners’ bones into, one of the prisoners broke out of his cell and was hiding in a dark corner anticipating the arrival of Sir Jacob Edwards at his cell. Finally, about an hour later Sir Jacob was making his rounds through his dungeon and noticed a prisoner was missing. Instead of Sir Jacob yelling out for the guards to search for the missing prisoner he took it upon himself to seek out the missing prisoner. Sir Jacob started calling out to the missing prisoner saying ""I know you're in here somewhere and when I find where you're hiding I'm going to snap each and every one of your bones into.""

""Before we begin lets all join hands and say a little prayer before we set up camp,"" replied Karen. After Karen said the prayer they all set up the tent and gathered firewood for the campfire.

Jen chimed in and said ""I think I'll turn in as well. What about you Brenda?"" Brenda answered ""I think I'll get some more firewood and stay up a while longer.""

GAMESMANSHIP,['David D Williams'],"For some, betraying justice is a small price to pay for riches. For others, the truth is more important than money. When deceit and integrity clash, gamesmanship controls the outcome. A legal thriller filled with compelling characters and suspense, GAMESMANSHIP is a masterful tale where justice becomes a dangerous game of hide-and-seek. After a workplace accident claims lives, a corrupt trial lawyer and a greedy business owner enter into a devious conspiracy to unfairly profit from the tragedy. For them, altering evidence — even committing murder — is justifiable when the shared reward is a half-billion dollars. The dead workers, a key witness, and the integrity of the justice system mean nothing to men who believe the rules don’t apply to them. But three things stand in the way of their plunder: the ingenuity of the only witness who knows what really happened; the tenacity of two young and honest lawyers who represent a brave widow; and the inspiring common sense of an old-style courtroom legend, whose bungling demeanor and simple ways mask the genius necessary to discover the complex crime of the conspirators. Praise for Gamesmanship: ""The struggle between good and evil, set in the context of a high-profile lawsuit with millions at stake, makes Gamesmanship a fun and fascinating read. Williams spins a tale of legal machinations with complete authority through characters you can never forget."" — Margaret Leslie Davis Bestselling Author of Dark Side of Fortune “A great novel, like a good script, stirs emotions and sweeps you away in story.

Looking-Glass Wars: Spies on British Screens since 1960,['Alan Burton'],"Looking-Glass Wars: Spies on British Screens since 1960 is a detailed historical and critical overview of espionage in British film and television in the important period since 1960. From that date, the British spy screen was transformed under the influence of the tremendous success of James Bond in the cinema (the spy thriller), and of the new-style spy writing of John le Carré and Len Deighton (the espionage story). In the 1960s, there developed a popular cycle of spy thrillers in the cinema and on television. The new study looks in detail at the cycle which in previous work has been largely neglected in favour of the James Bond films. The study also brings new attention to espionage on British television and popular secret agent series such as Spy Trap, Quiller and The Sandbaggers. It also gives attention to the more ‘realistic’ representation of spying in the film and television adaptations of le Carré and Deighton, and other dramas with a more serious intent. In addition, there is wholly original attention given to ‘nostalgic’ spy fictions on screen, adaptations of classic stories of espionage which were popular in the late 1970s and through the 1980s, and to ‘historical’ spy fiction, dramas which treated ‘real’ cases of espionage and their characters, most notably the notorious Cambridge Spies. Detailed attention is also given to the ‘secret state’ thriller, a cycle of paranoid screen dramas in the 1980s which portrayed the intelligence services in a conspiratorial light, best understood as a reaction to excessive official secrecy and anxieties about an unregulated security service. The study is brought up-to-date with an examination of screen espionage in Britain since the end of the Cold War. The approach is empirical and historical. The study examines the production and reception, literary and historical contexts of the films and dramas. It is the first detailed overview of the British spy screen in its crucial period since the 1960s and provides fresh attention to spy films, series and serials never previously considered.",555.0,['Performing Arts'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=24mEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=24mEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Thriller+%26+Suspense&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=11&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=24mEDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-24mEDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Death Island Lighthouse,['Drac Von Stoller'],"Seth Harrington always dreamed of living in a mansion with an ocean front view. He knew that this dream would only be a dream if he didn't finish school and become a doctor. Seth was finishing up his last semester in college and his dream was closer to becoming a reality. Finally, his graduation day was here and as he walked across the stage and his diploma was placed in his hands, he said, ""I made it, thank you so much,"" as he shook the President of the Colleges hand. Seth's private practice was flourishing and now that he had enough money saved up, he took a couple weeks off from his practice to find his beautiful mansion with an ocean front view. After about a week of searching and frustration Seth was ready to board the next flight home. Just as he was about to give up and turn his car around and head back to the airport, he decided to go down one more road. And thank goodness he did. There stood in an isolated area the most beautiful mansion he had ever seen, just like one he'd been dreaming about. Seth started tearing up and said to himself, ""If I would have given up my dream would have vanished in the ocean's breeze."" Seth pulled up to the mansion and stepped out of his vehicle and as he was canvassing the area he noticed a lighthouse about a couple of hundred yards away from the mansion. Seth said, ""That's cool a lighthouse, I wonder if that comes with the mansion."" He wasn't even sure if the mansion was for sale because he didn't see a For Sale sign in front of the mansion. The reason he didn't see a For Sale sign is because the sign fell over and was buried in the sand. The previous owners left a couple of years ago in terror. They took nothing with them just the clothes on their backs. Food was left on the kitchen table as though it was still occupied and the furniture was still in place. As Seth was strolling through the mansion he noticed a note next to the telephone in the study. Being curious, he picked up the note and read it. The note said, ""If you should be interested in purchasing the mansion call this number below. If you are wondering why food was left on the kitchen table and all the furniture was left behind, a death in the family kept me out of the country and would have been too expensive to ship all the furniture out of the country.

Scared of the Dark,['Drac Von Stoller'],"Michael was the youngest in his family, just eight years old and loved to watch his favorite TV show called Dark Shadows. Michael's older brother David and his sister Susan would constantly sneak up while Michael was watching Dark Shadows in the dark and scare him. Even though his brother and sister did a good job scaring him, what really scared Michael the most was the vampire Barnabas Collins. At night when Michael would get under the covers he would shake like a leaf and slowly pull the covers over his head. Michael's bedroom didn't have a door which scared the living daylights out of him. One stormy night when Michael was lying in bed trying to sleep, he saw a black cat walk across his window just as the lightening lit up the sky. Michael would jump out of bed and run down the hall to his parent’s room to sleep in their bed until morning. Michael's parents would tell him to stop watching Dark Shadows and maybe his fear of sleeping in his bed alone would diminish. Michael said, ""I wouldn't be so scared if my brother and sister would stop teasing me. Every now and then I would pull the covers slowly down below my eyes just enough to turn my head and see my brother walk across my doorway dressed in a cape and tell me he was coming to get me soon. I would just pull the covers over my head and shake like a leaf and pray for daylight."" The next night as Michael was lying in bed the caped figure went passed his bedroom doorway and the figure said, ""Soon, very soon, you will join the dead."" Michael said, ""That's it!"" and jumped out of bed in terror and ran down the hall yelling for his parents. Michael burst into his parents’ bedroom and dove in the covers shaking like a leaf. Michael's father said, ""What's the matter? Michael."" Michael replied, ""He's back and this time he said I would be joining the dead soon.""",4.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HBXgZxHphxAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HBXgZxHphxAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thriller+%26+Suspense&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=80&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HBXgZxHphxAC&rdid=book-HBXgZxHphxAC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Pyromaniac,['Drac Von Stoller'],"Dan Wells was Hickman County’s High School star quarterback and was close to graduating. Dan was the biggest player outside of sports if you know what I mean, and wasn't interested in being tied down by no girl. Marriage and a baby was the furthest thing on his mind. All he cared about was sports, and getting laid until Hickman County High's prettiest cheerleader Rhonda who was the most popular girl in school hooked up with Dan for a night of hot passion which led to an unwanted pregnancy, and a lot of shedding tears between both of them. Dan was looking forward to a full athletics scholarship to a college of his choice, but now that there was a baby staring them both in the eyes wanting their love, and attention all they both seen was how one moment in time destroyed their dreams of freedom. Abortion was discussed, but neither one had the guts to follow through with it. Their freedom that they both cherished was about to come to a screeching halt because they didn't enter the thought of using protection so now they both must suffer the consequences. After the baby was born, and they both got jobs, and had a one bedroom apartment to raise their unwanted baby. They didn’t have a name for their little mistake because they were too busy blaming each other for the mistake which would ultimately change their lives and everyone around them. Heartaches and Hell was headed their way that they could never have imagined. After weeks of blaming one another with tears of sadness they decided to give the baby a name which was not out of love. They named their new baby ""Demon"" because instead of taking the blame for their mistake they cast the blame on the baby for the mess they got their own selves into. Dan could barely hold down his job because he was so pissed off at Rhonda and the baby, he started drinking heavily to try, and drown out his problems, but drinking doesn't solve anything, but heartaches. Dan and Rhonda fought constantly, and the only way Rhonda could deal with the situation was with prescription drugs, another bad idea. Their baby was neglected on a constant basis and yelled at by them both. As the baby got older, and was sent out in the cruel world to school, and having a name as Demon, this would only backlash on his parents, and everyone that teased, and called him names. Resentment for his parents was at an all-time high that when he became a teenager all the anger and frustration that he bottled up inside was going to be unleashed at a hellish level. For the coldness that his parent’s bestowed upon him he was going to make his parents or anyone that stood in his way pay.",10.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BTTUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BTTUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thriller+%26+Suspense&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=126&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BTTUAgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BTTUAgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Svalbard Passage,['Thomas Kirkwood'],"THE SVALBARD PASSAGE is a rare work of fiction: the power and dramatic intensity of the writing are matched by the authenticity of the writers' extraordinary knowledge of political reality; the result is a work of imagination and prophecy. Readers of John Le Carr�, Richard Condon, Ken Follett, and Robert Ludlum will find it irresistible.The mysterious deaths of an international expedition of ice climbers on the remote face of the Spitsbergen glacier triggers what may be the first pre-emptive U.S. nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. The chain of events that follow moves swiftly and brilliantly from cosmopolitan, placid Oslo to the war-game rooms of the Pentagon and reaches a terrifying climax on the icy wastes of Spitsbergen, above the northern coast of Norway-and the Svalbard Passage. Caught in a terrifying net of brinksmanship are a worldly, elegant Norwegian diplomat; a fiery and beautiful German journalist; an uncommitted American pacifist; a ruthless CIA agent; and an equally ruthless Russian, a pawn of the KGB. Unknowingly, acting out of their private compulsions, they bring the world to the edge of global disaster.Through the weave of this richly atmospheric novel of suspense runs the stormy, sensual love story of Martin and Ulrike, lovers who come to maturity in the face of annihilation.EDITORIAL REVIEWS""Wryly drawn characters...absorbing.""-Kirkus Reviews ""Tense drama...spectacular.""-St. Louis Post Dispatch ""Riveting and fascinating.""-Lerner Newspapers ""An absorbing tale...the stuff of which movies are made.""-Rocky Mountain News ""Crackles ... a rousing good job."" -Akron Beacon-Journal",367.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=22KgWQfM4YYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=22KgWQfM4YYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thriller+%26+Suspense&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=158&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Scared to Death,['Drac Von Stoller'],"Henry was a very handsome man that the ladies always had their eyes on. Henry wasn't a wealthy man and wasn't born into wealth, but Henry always dreamed he'd marry into wealth someday and have all the precious things he dreamed about. When Henry was around his friends, he'd talk like he had money because most of his friends had an abundance of money. Not having any wealth like his friends, made Henry jealous. Henry's relationships were not much to speak of. Many girls broke up with him after just a few dates because he couldn't give lavish gifts. Henry's luck and entire life was about to change, because one of Henry's rich friends was invited to a party. His friend only knew the person that invited him, so he thought it would be a good idea to bring someone he knew to keep him company. Henry and his friend were having a good time at the party. Henry told Jack he was going to get some punch and would be back shortly. Just as Henry was scooping up some punch a pretty blonde woman approached Henry and introduced herself to him because Henry's appearance took her breath away. She knew he was the one for her and she wasn't going to let someone else take him away. ""Excuse me sir, could I please have some punch?"" asked Monique. ""Sure,"" said Henry. Henry was blown away by her beauty and was very happy they met. Monique said, ""I heard you're a friend of Jack's, he's really a great guy. Don't you think so?"" ""Yeah, he's been a close friend of mine for many years. Jack and I went to the same schools growing up,"" said Henry. ""I tell you what, would you like to come over to my place this Saturday around 6:00 and I'll cook you a good meal?"" asked Monique. ""I'd be delighted to try your cooking. I'm sure I won't be disappointed,"" said Henry. ""Great! I'd like to introduce you to my godparents,"" Monique said. After the party was over Monique asked Henry if he would escort her to her car. As Monique got in her car and Henry was turning away to meet up with Jack, Monique rolled down her window in the car and said ""Henry could you come over here for a moment?"" Then she said, ""Henry, it's quite alright if you'd like to kiss me goodbye."" So Henry kissed her and said, ""Could I kiss you one more time?"" Monique, replied, ""Sure! That's fine with me."" After they kissed Monique said, ""I'll see you Saturday and don't be late."" Henry replied, ""Don't you worry, I won't be late."" Monique drove off into the sunset to her mansion. Henry got into the car with Jack and Jack asked, ""How'd it go Henry?"" Henry said, ""I believe I just found the woman I've been searching for all of my life."" ""That's great! I hope it works out for you both,"" said Jack."" ""Jack, she wants me to meet her god parents this Saturday."" Jack responded, ""Did you know her parents left her a vast fortune before their untimely death several years ago? They died when their private jet crashed over Mexico during a vacation. You think I've got a lot of money Monique's wealth makes me look poor. If you marry Monique you'll be set for life."" ""That's what I'm banking on,"" said Henry. Jack said, ""Well here's where I drop you off and let me know how Saturday goes."" ""I'll let you know, don't worry,"" said Henry. Henry bought a nice suit to impress Monique for their Saturday date. When Henry was finished with dinner at Monique's, Henry gave Monique a kiss goodbye and Monique said ""Why don't you spend the night with me? This big house gets pretty lonely at night and I could sure use the company."" ""Are you sure it's okay? You really don't know me that well,"" said Henry. ""Come on Henry! I don't bite!"" said Monique. Henry accepted Monique's invitation and they shared some wine together before turning in for the night. As Monique and Henry lay in bed together Monique asked Henry if he would be interested in moving in with her. Henry replied ""I would love to move in with you. I'm tired of being a bachelor and I really enjoy being with you. By the end of the week Henry moved into Monique's mansion and within a month they were married. Many years had passed, there were good times and bad times. Henry liked his scotch and whiskey and it showed. Henry loved Monique's money more than her. Monique was very depressed and not happy with Henry's spending. Henry and Monique fought a lot and that’s probably what fueled Henry's drinking and Monique's depression. It was hard for Monique to get around because she had fallen down the stairs and shattered the bones in her right leg. She had to limp around. Monique's beauty was deteriorating and Henry felt it was time to get rid of Monique so he could have her fortune to himself.",10.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QfeO7iwL1kwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QfeO7iwL1kwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thriller+%26+Suspense&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=161&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QfeO7iwL1kwC&rdid=book-QfeO7iwL1kwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

They were inseparable, they always did things together. It seemed they had it all, until one day when Henry's maid came into his study and locked the door behind her. Catherine was her name and she had the most beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair on any woman around. Catherine had her eyes on Henry for quite some time. She couldn't control her feelings anymore and decided now was the time. Catherine approached the back of Henry's chair and put her hands on his shoulders, squeezing them ever so lightly. Catherine's touch would make any man's heart melt. She said, ""Henry, you need to relax more often and not be so absorbed in your work. I can give you what you need anytime you want. Catherine bent over and blew in his ear and whispered, ""Henry you know you need me as much as I need you,"" said Catherine. ""Henry, you and Elizabeth's passion has run dry and I know you are a very lonely man. Let me be the one to bring that passion back into your life,"" said Catherine. Catherine and Henry engaged in a romantic affair that lasted many months until Henry's wife noticed that in the middle of the night, Henry would slip out of their bed and leave to meet his lover, Catherine down in the family crypt where their noises wouldn't be heard echoing throughout the castle. Catherine started getting suspicious and curious as to where Henry was going to in the middle of the night. Instead of asking him where he was going in the middle of the night, Elizabeth decided she would pretend she was asleep and follow her husband to see what he was up to. Elizabeth let Henry get down the hall to the top of the stairs. Then Elizabeth quietly got out of bed and softly walked down to the foot of the stairs and watched Henry open the door that led down to the family crypt.

"Georgette Heyer, History and Historical Fiction","['Samantha J. Rayner', 'Kim Wilkins']","The Nonesuch is the name of one of Georgette Heyer’s most famous novels. It means a person or thing without equal, and Georgette Heyer is certainly that. Her historical works inspire a fiercely loyal, international readership and are championed by literary figures such as A. S. Byatt and Stephen Fry. Georgette Heyer, History, and Historical Fiction brings together an eclectic range of chapters from scholars all over the world to explore the contexts of Heyer’s career. Divided into four parts – gender; genre; sources; and circulation and reception – the volume draws on scholarship on Heyer and her contemporaries to show how her work sits in a chain of influence, and why it remains pertinent to current conversations on books and publishing in the twenty-first century. Heyer’s impact on science fiction is accounted for, as are the milieu she was writing in, the many subsequent works that owe Heyer’s writing a debt, and new methods for analysing these enduring books. From the gothic to data science, there is something for everyone in this volume; a celebration of Heyer’s ‘nonesuch’ status amongst historical novelists, proving that she and her contemporary women writers deserve to be read (and studied) as more than just guilty pleasures.",320.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RRogEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RRogEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RRogEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RRogEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Clansman,['Thomas Dixon (Jr.)'],"The novel describes the social, political, and economic disintegration that plagued the South during Reconstruction, depicting the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the reactions of two families to racial conflict. It was written as a message to Northerners to maintain racial segregation, as the work claimed that blacks when free would turn savage and violent, committing crimes such as murder, rape and robbery far out of proportion to their percentage of the population. The enemy in The Clansman is not the freed slaves, but the Republican led Reconstruction movement which the Ku Klux Klan is founded against.",414.0,['Racism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wKJHp_anQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-wKJHp_anQkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=83&source=gbs_api,An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wKJHp_anQkC&rdid=book--wKJHp_anQkC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Forest Days,['George Payne Rainsford James'],"Prolific English writer George P.R. James presents this work of historical fiction in three volumes. The long, flowing prose is atypical of any work in the Robin Hood tome, and with the addition of never-before-seen characters and lengthy dialogues, it is nearly unrecognizable. By the author's own account, he has made a bold change in the folklore setting the story during the reign of Henry III instead of Richard I. He claims to have made great pains to remain historically accurate in this vein. To say that Forest Days is simply another telling of Robin Hood is more than inaccurate. It is a work of its own, a Romantic Period piece that does not fit neatly into any category, but more than that, it's a good read.",307.0,['Great Britain'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ork8AAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ork8AAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=102&source=gbs_api,A Romance of Old Times,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ork8AAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-ork8AAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Literature Against Criticism,['Martin Paul Eve'],"This is a book about the power game currently being played out between two symbiotic cultural institutions: the university and the novel. As the number of hyper-knowledgeable literary fans grows, students and researchers in English departments waver between dismissing and harnessing voices outside the academy. Meanwhile, the role that the university plays in contemporary literary fiction is becoming increasingly complex and metafictional, moving far beyond the ‘campus novel’ of the mid-twentieth century. Martin Paul Eve’s engaging and far-reaching study explores the novel's contribution to the ongoing displacement of cultural authority away from university English. Spanning the works of Jennifer Egan, Ishmael Reed, Tom McCarthy, Sarah Waters, Percival Everett, Roberto Bolaño and many others, Literature Against Criticism forces us to re-think our previous notions about the relationship between those who write literary fiction and those who critique it.",250.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qXxGDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qXxGDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=158&source=gbs_api,University English and Contemporary Fiction in Conflict,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qXxGDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qXxGDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Georgiana Darcy's Diary,['Anna Elliott'],"Mr. Darcy's younger sister searches for her own happily-ever-after... The year is 1814, and it is springtime at Pemberley. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have married. But now a new romance is in the air, along with high fashion, elegant manners, scandal, deception, and the wonderful hope of a true and lasting love. Shy Georgiana Darcy has been content to remain unmarried, living with her brother and his new bride. But Elizabeth and Darcy's fairy-tale love reminds Georgiana daily that she has found no true love of her own. And perhaps never will, for she is convinced the one man she secretly cares for will never love her in return. Georgiana's domineering aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, has determined that Georgiana shall marry, and has a list of eligible bachelors in mind. But which of the suitors are sincere, and which are merely interested in Georgiana's fortune? Georgiana must learn to trust her heart--and rely on her courage--for she also faces the return of the man who could ruin her reputation and spoil a happy ending, just when it finally lies within her grasp.

The Bounty from the Beach,['Sylvie Largeaud-Ortega'],"The Bounty from the Beach is a collection of cross-disciplinary essays, capitalising on a widely shared fascination for the Bounty story in order to draw scholarly attention to Oceania. It aims to reorient the Bounty focus away from the West, where most Bountynarratives and studies have emerged, to the Pacific, where most of the original events unfolded. It investigates the Bounty heritage from the standpoint of the beach, Greg Dening’s metaphor for culture contact and conflict in the Pacific Islands: this liminal place that transforms Islanders and voyagers, islands and ships, each time it is crossed. It analyses the way newcomers create new islands, and how these changes may occasionally impact the world. This volume examines the ‘little people’, to use another of Dening’s expressions, who stand ‘on both sides of the beach’: they are Polynesian or European or, as beaches are crossed and remade, no longer one without the other, but bound together in processes of change. Among these people are Bounty sailors, beachcombers, Pitcairners and indigenous Pacific Islanders of the past and the present. This collection also explores the works of some renowned Western writers and actors who, turning mutineers after their own fashion and in their own times, themselves crossed the beach and attempted to illuminate the ‘little people’ involved in the Bounty narratives. These prominent writers and actors put the spotlight on characters who were silenced on account of race, class or geographical distance from the dominant centres of power. Inspired by Dening’s empowering voice, our purpose is to fill that silence. Just as it criss-crosses the ocean, progressing with the ship through time and space, TheBounty from the Beach ranges far and wide across disciplines, methodologies and scholarly styles. Its multidisciplinary course contributes to illuminate the multiple ways in which the Bounty heritage embraces diverse horizons. It throws light on the colonial discourse that undertook to stifle Pacific Islander agency, and the neocolonial policies that have been applied to Oceania, and still are: hegemonic moves that have led to global environmental, nuclear and ecological hazards. As a whole, the collection contends that what unfolds in this vast ocean matters: the stakes are high for the whole human community.",273.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yDd7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yDd7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=340&source=gbs_api,Cross-Cultural and Cross-Disciplinary Essays,No link available
"Italian Signs, American Streets",['Fred L. Gardaphé'],"In the first major critical reading of Italian American narrative literature in two decades, Fred L. Gardaphé presents an interpretive overview of Italian American literary history. Examining works from the turn of the twentieth century to the present, he develops a new perspective--variously historical, philosophical, and cultural--by which American writers of Italian descent can be read, increasing the discursive power of an ethnic literature that has received too little serious critical attention. Gardaphé draws on Vico's concept of history, as well as the work of Gramsci, to establish a culture-specific approach to reading Italian American literature. He begins his historical reading with narratives informed by oral traditions, primarily autobiography and autobiographical fiction written by immigrants. From these earliest social-realist narratives, Gardaphé traces the evolution of this literature through tales of ""the godfather"" and the mafia; the ""reinvention of ethnicity"" in works by Helen Barolini, Tina DeRosa, and Carole Maso; the move beyond ethnicity in fiction by Don DeLillo and Gilbert Sorrentino; to the short fiction of Mary Caponegro, which points to a new direction in Italian American writing. The result is both an ethnography of Italian American narrative and a model for reading the signs that mark the ""self-fashioning"" inherent in literary and cultural production. Italian Signs, American Streets promises to become a landmark in the understanding of literature and culture produced by Italian Americans. It will be of interest not only to students, critics, and scholars of this ethnic experience, but also to those concerned with American literature in general and the place of immigrant and ethnic literatures within that wide framework.",260.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OOxrAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OOxrAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=346&source=gbs_api,The Evolution of Italian American Narrative,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OOxrAAAAIAAJ&rdid=book-OOxrAAAAIAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Romance of K'tut Tantri and Indonesia,['Timothy Lindsey'],"This historiographic study of K'tut Tantri - alias Vannen Walker, the journalist from the Isle of Man; Muriel Pearson, the unhappy wife; and Surabaya Sue, the notorious revolutionary - compares her romantic and colorful autobiography, Revolt in Paradise, with other versions of her past, including those of her fellow Bali colonists and her revolutionary comrades, as well as her foes, the Dutch, and various intelligence organizations. These alternatives accounts of her past question the image of K'tut Tantri as hero, portraying her instead as dishonest, unstable, egotistical, and immoral. Such criticisms have overshadowed proper recognition of her role in the development of modern Indonesia, both as a bohemian hotelier in between-wars Bali and later as propaganda broadcaster and adviser to Indonesian revolutionary leaders including Soekarno, Sutomo, and Syarifuddin. Focusing on the nature of biography and autobiography, this book analyses K'tut Tantri's self-defeating battle to use history - in text and film script - to define her identity and reappropriate her past. An examination of the use of ideas of ""truth"" and ""fiction"" in understanding the past leads to broader consideration of the nature of history and its uses. Finally, an attempt is made to reconcile the deconstruction of K'tut Tantri's autobiography with both an acceptance of the validity of ""alternative"" historical genres and an acceptance of the problems inherent in writing a history of a living person.

Exploring Cultural Identities in Jean Rhys’ Fiction,['Cristina-Georgiana Voicu'],"Using a theoretical approach and a critical summary, combining the perspectives in the postcolonial theory, psychoanalysis and narratology with the tools of hermeneutics and deconstruction, this book argues that Jean Rhys’s work can be subsumed under a poetics of cultural identity and hybridity. It also demonstrates the validity of the concept of hybridization as the expression of identity formation; the cultural boundaries variability; the opposition self-otherness, authenticity-fiction, trans-textuality; and the relevance of an integrated approach to multiple cultural identities as an encountering and negotiation space between writer, reader and work. The complexity of ontological and epistemological representation involves an interdisciplinary approach that blends a literary interpretive approach to social, anthropological, cultural and historical perspectives. The book concludes that in the author’s fictional universe, cultural identity is represented as a general human experience that transcends the specific conditionalities of geographical contexts, history and culture. The construction of identity by Jean Rhys is represented by the dichotomy of marginal identity and the identification with a human ideal designed either by the hegemonic discourse or metropolitan culture or by the dominant ideology. The identification with a pattern of cultural authenticity, of racial, ethnic, or national purism is presented as a purely destructive cultural projection, leading to the creation of a static universe in opposition to the diversity of human feelings and aspirations. Jean Rhys’s fictional discourse lies between “the anxiety of authorship” and “the anxiety of influence” and shows the postcolonial era of uprooting and migration in which the national ownership diluted the image of a “home” ambiguous located at the boundary between a myth of origins and a myth of becoming. The relationship between the individual and socio-cultural space is thus shaped in a dual hybrid position.",140.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=748oCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=748oCQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=356&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=748oCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-748oCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

She is exiled to Chepstow in South Wales, and his is reported to have died in India, but all ends happily and their fortunes come right at the end of the novel.

Did the Soviets or the Americans invent simultaneous interpreting equipment? How did the US government train its first Chinese interpreters? Why is it that Taiwanese interpreters were executed for Japanese war crimes? Bringing together papers from an international symposium held at Rikkyo University in 2014 along with two select pieces, this volume pursues such questions in an eclectic exploration of the practice of interpreting, the recruitment of interpreters, and the challenges interpreters have faced in diplomacy, colonization, religion, war, and occupation. It also introduces innovative use of photography, artifacts, personal journals, and fiction as tools for the historical study of interpreters and interpreting. Targeted at practitioners, scholars, and students of interpreting, translation, and history, the new insights presented in the ten original articles aim to spark discussion and research on the vital roles interpreters have played in intercultural communication through history.

The Mandela Effect Trilogy,['Eric Blue'],"Ever wondered about how it would be to go back in time and change history? The satirical novel, The Mandela Effect, gives an insight into how a Rainbow Nation South Africa of 2010 celebrated the hosting of the FIFA 2010 World Cup. Of course, it wasn’t always like that. When a gas pipe blast in a local restaurant takes law student Lindiwe Buthelezi out of her comfort zone and back to the year 1987 when apartheid (racial segregation) was at its worst, she soon realises the important role that she has to play in following in her late mother’s footsteps. Lindiwe gets to experience the bad of Black and White on all fronts of life before getting to the blessings! African National Congress icon Nelson Mandela is believed to be locked away on Robben Island for failing to renounce violence against the state. While some hard-line left wingers felt that Mandela may sell out to the apartheid government, several right-wing members believed that eliminating Mandela would send a strong message to the so-called communist liberation struggle. Add in the African American duo of CNN political reporter Louise Burrell and Washington D.C.-based human rights lawyer Pearce Ellison, and the race is on to plot a smooth way to democracy for the New South Africa. About Author: Eric Blue is a modern era storyteller who sees things differently than most writers do. He spots the “story behind the story” and his mind works on the “what could have been” scenario. He focuses on the mirror image to give the readers an in-depth look at how life could have been. His work may be fiction, but it also could have been today’s headline news.

The Epistolary Renaissance,"['Maria Löschnigg', 'Rebekka Schuh']","Since the late twentieth century, letters in literature have seen a remarkable renaissance. The prominence of letters in recent fiction is due in part to the rediscovery, by contemporary writers, of letters as an effective tool for rendering aspects of historicity, liminality, marginalization and the expression of subjectivity vis-à-vis an ‘other’; it is also due, however, to the artistically challenging inclusion of the new electronic media of communication into fiction. While studies of epistolary fiction have so far concentrated on the eighteenth century and on thematic concerns, this volume charts the epistolary renaissance in recent literature, entering new territory by also focusing on the aesthetic implications of the epistolary mode. In particular, the essays in this volume illuminate the potential of the epistolary (including digital forms) for rendering contemporary sensitivities. The volume thus offers a comprehensive assessment of letter narratives in contemporary literature. Through its focus on the aesthetic and structural aspects of new epistolary fiction, the inclusion of various narrative forms, and the consideration of both conventional letters and their new digital kindred, The Epistolary Renaissance offers novel insight into a multi-facetted (re)new(ed) genre.",305.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BI5uDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BI5uDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=387&source=gbs_api,A Critical Approach to Contemporary Letter Narratives in Anglophone Fiction,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BI5uDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BI5uDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

From Buchenwald to Havana,['Julian Markels'],"A boundary-breaking book that moves subtly between genres, from memoir and Bildungsroman to social activism and cultural critique. It has the force of personal experience, the meditative pleasures of a novel, and the commitment of a social activist written by a polymath, brilliant thinker, and thoughtful writer. It offers a complex and masterfully written narrative in which events that exceed conventional historical analysis—Buchenwald; the Cold War; McCarthyism; the civil rights, feminist, and anti-war movements; the Cuban experiment in socialist humanism—are interpreted as a dialectics of history and agency. The book has a particular poignancy for the present moment in which the task of social change and struggle for a society of equality have become urgent. It is the work of a committed life struggling for a socialist humanism that, as Markels argues, “enables us not just to dream of full lives but also to find ways to live them, by all and for the good of all.” —Teresa Ebert, author of The Task of Cultural Critique From Buchenwald to Havana is lucid and humane . . . complex, fluid, rich in possibilities . . . learned and wise, and I sure learned a great deal from reading it. And I loved it. It reflects on socialist moments succinctly and it dramatizes a socialism which is attractive and always open to rethinking, It also shows how a person can be honest about pain and mistakes without spending his life only in regret and atonement.—Malcolm Griffith, Emeritus Professor of English, University of Washington Julian Markels has taken the Chinese curse, ""May you live in interesting times,"" and turned it into a blessing for his readers in this rich and compelling account of his life inside the academy and out. As Markels recounts his personal journey, he gives us insights into significant moments in the history of Ohio State University; Marxist literary criticism and theory; Cuba after Castro; and much more. His is a life well-lived--and well-told. —Jim Phelan, author of Experiencing Fiction: Judgments, Progressions, and the Rhetorical Theory of Narrative",,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TQEUveT2-gQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TQEUveT2-gQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=393&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Pink and White Tyranny,['Harriet Beecher Stowe'],"Originally published in 1871, Pink and White Tyranny is, seemingly, a light, comic story about a frivolous young girl who marries for money. However, as with most of Beecher Stowe's writings, things are not what they appear on the surface. This """"society novel,"""" instead, is a critique of the nineteenth-century's dominant view that women should use their femininity to gain power. Reflective of Stowe's progressive moral and domestic views, the novel is a refreshing work of social satire that showcases Stowe's comic abilities as well as her progressive views.",341.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aKrz28koY1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aKrz28koY1sC&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=396&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Middlemarch,['Adam Roberts'],"In Middlemarch, George Eliot draws a character passionately absorbed by abstruse allusion and obscure epigraphs. Casaubon’s obsession is a cautionary tale, but Adam Roberts nonetheless sees in him an invitation to take Eliot’s use of epigraphy and allusion seriously, and this book is an attempt to do just that. Roberts considers the epigraph as a mirror that refracts the meaning of a text, and that thus carries important resonances for the way Eliot’s novels generate their meanings. In this lively and provoking study, he tracks down those allusions and quotations that have hitherto gone unidentified by scholars, examining their relationship to the text in which they sit to unfurl a broader argument about the novel – both this novel, and the novel form itself. Middlemarch: Epigraphs and Mirrors is both a study of George Eliot and a meditation on the textuality of fiction. It is essential reading for specialists and students of George Eliot, the nineteenth century novel, and intertextuality. It will also richly reward anyone who has ever taken pleasure in Middlemarch.",160.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7goEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z7goEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=399&source=gbs_api,Epigraphs and Mirrors,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z7goEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-z7goEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Imagining Global Amsterdam,['Marco de Waard'],"Imagining Global Amsterdam gaat over het beeld van Amsterdam in film, literatuur, visuele kunst en in het moderne stedelijke discours, in het bijzonder in de context van de mondialisering. De essays gaan onder andere dieper in op Amsterdam als een lieu de mémoire van de vroeg-moderne wereldhandel. Wat betekent deze herinnering in de hedendaagse cultuur? Waarom verwijzen zo veel contemporaine films en romans naar dit verleden terug? Ook het (inter)nationale imago van Amsterdam als een multicultureel en ultra-tolerant ‘%x;global village’%x; komt aan bod. Waarom is dit beeld zo persistent, en hoe heeft het zich in de loop van de laatste decennia ontwikkeld? Tot slot wordt ingegaan op de vraag hoe mondialiseringsprocessen ingrijpen in de stadscultuur, zoals in het prostitutiegebied op de Wallen en via de erfgoedindustrie. Hoe manifesteert de mondialisering zich in de stad, en welke rol speelt beeldvorming daarbij?

Jane Austen,['Nora Bartlett'],"This exhilarating collection of essays is the product of a lifetime's engagement with Jane Austen's writing. They are modest, searching, wonderfully perceptive essays from which all lovers of Jane Austen, the most knowledgeable as well as those who have just discovered her, will have much to learn. They are essays that send us back to the novels with a renewed understanding of Jane Austen's extraordinary achievement. Prof. Richard Cronin, University of Glasgow This volume presents an exhilarating and insightful collection of essays on Jane Austen – distilling the author’s deep understanding and appreciation of Austen’s works across a lifetime. The volume is both intra- and inter-textual in focus, ranging from perceptive analysis of individual scenes to the exploration of motifs across Austen’s fiction. Full of astute connections, these lively discussions hinge on the study of human behaviour – from family relationships to sickness and hypochondria – highlighting Austen’s artful literary techniques and her powers of human observation. Jane Austen: Reflections of a Reader by (the late) Nora Bartlett is a brilliant contribution to the field of Jane Austen studies, both in its accessible style (which preserves the oral register of the original lectures), and in its foregrounding of the reader in a warm, compelling and incisive conversation about Austen’s works.

Lady Juliana knows someone is trying to kill her father. The problem is getting anyone to believe her. Her father thinks she’s imagining things. Her brother that she’s seeking attention. And the man her brother hired to bring her back home…well, he thinks nothing much of her at all. Brogan Duffy has clawed his way up from the streets to become the lead investigator on his very first inquiry case. The fact that it is to retrieve a spoiled aristocrat playing at intrigue is of no consequence. Nor is the fact that she beguiles him like no other woman. He has a job to do, and he won’t let anything stand in his way, not even this illogical attraction. But Juliana might not be imagining the threat. And when it’s her life that’s on the line, Brogan has to decide to what lengths he’ll go to keep her safe. Because in order to resolve this make-or-break case in his career, Brogan might have to hazard more than his heart.

It is not merely an old, grey-moustached officer whom you see eating his omelette or draining his glass, but it is a fragment of history. In me you see one of the last of those wonderful men, the men who were veterans when they were yet boys, who learned to use a sword earlier than a razor, and who during a hundred battles had never once let the enemy see the colour of their knapsacks. For twenty years we were teaching Europe how to fight, and even when they had learned their lesson it was only the thermometer, and never the bayonet, which could break the Grand Army down. Berlin, Naples, Vienna, Madrid, Lisbon, Moscow-we stabled our horses in them all. Yes, my friends, I say again that you do well to send your children to me with flowers, for these ears have heard the trumpet calls of France, and these eyes have seen her standards in lands where they may never be seen again. Even now, when I doze in my arm-chair, I can see those great warriors stream before me-the green-jacketed chasseurs, the giant cuirassiers, Poniatowsky's lancers, the white-mantled dragoons, the nodding bearskins of the horse grenadiers.

How to Read Shakespeare Like a Royal (Vol 1),['Charles N. Pope'],"The Shakespearean plays contain a stunning breadth and depth of knowledge about English history, European royal history, classical and contemporary literature, and about the complex relationships between the various royal courts of the day. Authorship by the Elizabethan Court is therefore discernible based on content alone, that is, by what the plays revealed and just as importantly, what they threatened to reveal about international royal affairs if the will of Elizabeth was not respected. One of the most significant (and surprising) functions of the plays was to act as a type of ""Defense Program"" for Queen Elizabeth's throne against her European rivals. However, the plays also served to instill solidarity in the members of the Elizabethan Court and to inspire the English people as well. The plays accomplished all of this without coming across as overly pedantic. They were not merely great works of literature, but a brilliant expression of Elizabethan foreign and domestic policy! The story of Shakespeare turns out to be the story of Don Juan of Austria, from his princely legitimization as a boy; to liaisons with royals ladies from his teens; to being hailed at the age of 24 as “Savior of Europe” at the Battle of Lepanto (1571); to his suppression by jealous males of the Habsburg royal family (1578); and to his rehab by Queen Elizabeth under the English identity of George Carey. As George Carey, Don Juan had been present at the christening of his true son King James in Scotland (1566) and in command of the strategic Isle of Wight during the invasion of the Spanish Armada (1588). He was intimately involved in the founding of the Shakespeare Company both before and after becoming Queen Elizabeth’s “Lord Chamberlain.” The rise, fall and rising again of this international man of mystery was the central theme of the Shakespeare plays. He and Queen Elizabeth appear again and again in the plays, and under such character names as Claudio and Isabella in Measure for Measure; Claudio and Hero in Much Ado About Nothing; Claudius and Gertrude in Hamlet; Bassanio and Portia in The Merchant of Venice; Duke Theseus and Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night’s Dream; Petruchio and Kate in The Taming of the Shrew; and even Falstaff and Mistress Quickly of the Henry IV plays.

Millicent Garrett Fawcett,"['Melissa Terras', 'Elizabeth Crawford']","‘Courage calls to courage everywhere’ is the best-known phrase associated with Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847-1929), the leading UK suffragist and campaigner of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But what is the source of her quote, and what is its context? This book reproduces Fawcett’s essential speeches, pamphlets and newspaper columns to tell the story of her dynamic contribution to public life. Thirty-five texts and 22 images are contextualised and linked to contemporary news coverage as well as to historical and literary references. These speeches, articles, artworks and photographs cover both the advances and the defeats in the campaign for women’s votes. They also demonstrate a variety of the topics and causes Fawcett pursued: the provision of education for women; feminist history; a love of literature (and Fawcett’s own attempt at fiction); purity and temperance; the campaign against employment of children; the British Army’s approach to the South African War; the Unionist cause against Home Rule for Ireland; and the role of suffrage organisations during World War I. Here is a rich, intertextual web of literary works, preferred reading material, organisations, contacts, friends, and sometimes enemies, that reveals Fawcett the individual throughout 61 years of campaigning. The first scholarly appraisal of Fawcett in over 30 years, this is essential reading for those wishing to understand the varied political, social and cultural contributions of Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett. Praise for Millicent Garrett Fawcett: Selected writings 'Millicent Fawcett’s influence in the suffrage movement is often overlooked in favour of the more radical suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. Millicent was hugely important, concentrating on non violent rational persuasion. This book explains the work of this dogged suffragist.' Dame Jenni Murray - former president Fawcett Society 'Millicent Garrett Fawcett: Selected writings invites the reader to delve into the life and passions of this great suffragist leader. Millicent Fawcett paved the way for women to take their place in public life, that’s why I’m so proud that in 2018, her sculpture was unveiled in London, becoming Parliament Square’s first-ever statue of a woman. The statue depicts Millicent holding a banner bearing the powerful quote, “Courage Calls to Courage Everywhere”. This book explores important aspects of the rich and too-often untold history of women’s rights, including the origins of that inspirational quote.' Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London 'This is a vital collection of the vital speeches of a vital person. You need to read this to understand the history of Millicent Fawcett and if you don’t understand the history of Millicent Fawcett you don’t understand one of the most important developments in modern civilisation.' Lord Daniel Finkelstein 'Millicent Fawcett is one of the pivotal voices in UK political history. Her work paved the way for every woman who has ever taken her place in a parliament anywhere on these islands. When any of us talk about standing on the shoulders of giants, Millicent Fawcett was that giant of female empowerment.' Baroness Ruth Davidson 'Millicent Fawcett was one of the most influential figures of her age, yet history has tended to overlook her. Extraordinarily astute and forward-thinking, she inspired women to change their world by giving them a political voice, and the confidence to use it. Thanks to this collection, which is both scholarly and accessible, we can now hear her own voice as never before. She continues to inspire us to speak out on behalf of women's progress everywhere.' Jane Robinson, Senior Associate, Somerville College, Oxford; author of Ladies Can't Climb Ladders: The Pioneering Adventures of the First Professional Women 'Terras and Crawford have brought together a powerful and accessible collection of contributions from Millicent Garrett Fawcett, whose speeches and writings gave a political voice to the women of her generation.

Context in Literary and Cultural Studies,"['Jakob Ladegaard', 'Jakob Gaardbo Nielsen']","Context in Literary and Cultural Studies is an interdisciplinary volume that deals with the challenges of studying works of art and literature in their historical context today. The relationship between artworks and context has long been a central concern for aesthetic and cultural disciplines, and the question of context has been asked anew in all eras. Developments in contemporary culture and technology, as well as new theoretical and methodological orientations in the humanities, once again prompt us to rethink context in literary and cultural studies. This volume takes up that challenge. Introducing readers to new developments in literary and cultural theory, Context in Literary and Cultural Studies connects all disciplines related to these areas to provide an interdisciplinary overview of the challenges different scholarly fields today meet in their studies of artworks in context. Spanning a number of countries, and covering subjects from nineteenth-century novels to rave culture, the chapters together constitute an informed, diverse and wide-ranging discussion.

The Parasite,['Arthur Conan Doyle'],"March 24. The spring is fairly with us now. Outside my laboratory window the great chestnut-tree is all covered with the big, glutinous, gummy buds, some of which have already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks. As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them-everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! I can see it without, and I can feel it within. We also have our spring when the little arterioles dilate, the lymph flows in a brisker stream, the glands work harder, winnowing and straining. Every year nature readjusts the whole machine. I can feel the ferment in my blood at this very moment, and as the cool sunshine pours through my window I could dance about in it like a gnat. So I should, only that Charles Sadler would rush upstairs to know what was the matter. Besides, I must remember that I am Professor Gilroy.

Snakes,['Catherine Cooper Hopley'],"Excerpt from Snakes: Curiosities and Wonders of Serpent Life On the other hand, those who can look at a snake with unprejudiced eyes and study its habits, find continual reason to wonder at and admire the extraordinary features which exhibit themselves in its organization. Owing to their retiring habits, many of them nocturnal, and partly in consequence Of preconceived errors, less is understood about them than almost any other natural group of animals; therefore - as the reader Will discover - a student, when left to himself, has to wade through ages of writers in order to find out what to believe regarding them. Scientific Ophiologists are still engaged in settling mooted questions concerning them. But apart from science there is a glamour of poetry, romance, and mystery about Snakes, and not without reason. There has been a great deal of what we may call 'drawing-room Natural History' of late years charmingly sensational and romantic; attractive also in illustrations and colouring, but not always intended as reliable guides for students.

Languages of Science in the Eighteenth Century,['Britt-Louise Gunnarsson'],"The eighteenth century is an important period both in the history of science and in the history of languages. Interest in science, and especially in the useful sciences, exploded and a new, modern approach to scientific discovery and the accumulation of knowledge emerged. It was during this century, too, that ideas on language and language practice began to change. Latin had been more or less the only written language used for scientific purposes, but gradually the vernaculars became established as fully acceptable alternatives for scientific writing. The period is of interest, moreover, from a genre-historical point of view. Encyclopedias, dictionaries and also correspondence played a key role in the spread of scientific ideas. At the time, writing on scientific matters was not as distinct from fiction, poetry or religious texts as it is today, a fact which also gave a creative liberty to individual writers. In this volume, seventeen authors explore, from a variety of angles, the construction of a scientific language and discourse. The chapters are thematically organized into four sections, each contributing to our understanding of this dynamic period in the history of science: their themes are the forming of scientific communities, the emergence of new languages of science, the spread of scientific ideas, and the development of scientific writing. A particular focus is placed on the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778). From the point of view of the natural sciences, Linnaeus is renowned for his principles for defining genera and species of organisms and his creation of a uniform system for naming them. From the standpoint of this volume, however, he is also of interest as an example of a European scientist of the eighteenth century. This volume is unique both in its broad linguistic approach - including studies on textlinguistics, stylistics, sociolinguistics, lexicon and nomenclature - and in its combination of language studies, philosophy of language, history and sociology of science. The book covers writing in different European languages: Swedish, German, French, English, Latin, Portuguese, and Russian. With its focus on the history of scientific language and discourse during a dynamic period in Europe, the book promises to contribute to new insights both for readers interested in language history and those with an interest in the history of ideas and thought.",376.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kgmh1ogWA1cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kgmh1ogWA1cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=480&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kgmh1ogWA1cC&rdid=book-kgmh1ogWA1cC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Message,['Āyatullah Ja‘far Subḥānī'],"This book presents an inspiring material based on authentic historical documents. One of its salient features is that the author has taken extreme care in narrating historical events and at the same time he has endeavoured as a research scholar, to approach them with an analytical mind also.

Introduction to Nordic Cultures,"['Annika Lindskog', 'Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen']","Introduction to Nordic Cultures is an innovative, interdisciplinary introduction to Nordic history, cultures and societies from medieval times to today. The textbook spans the whole Nordic region, covering historical periods from the Viking Age to modern society, and engages with a range of subjects: from runic inscriptions on iron rings and stone monuments, via eighteenth-century scientists, Ibsen’s dramas and turn-of-the-century travel, to twentieth-century health films and the welfare state, nature ideology, Greenlandic literature, Nordic Noir, migration, ‘new’ Scandinavians, and stereotypes of the Nordic. The chapters provide fundamental knowledge and insights into the history and structures of Nordic societies, while constructing critical analyses around specific case studies that help build an informed picture of how societies grow and of the interplay between history, politics, culture, geography and people. Introduction to Nordic Cultures is a tool for understanding issues related to the Nordic region as a whole, offering the reader engaging and stimulating ways of discovering a variety of cultural expressions, historical developments and local preoccupations. The textbook is a valuable resource for undergraduate students of Scandinavian and Nordic studies, as well as students of European history, culture, literature and linguistics.",244.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEfmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mEfmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=490&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mEfmDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mEfmDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Contesting Nordicness,"['Jani Marjanen', 'Johan Strang', 'Mary Hilson']","The terms ‘Nordic’ and ‘Scandinavian’ are widely used to refer to the politics, society and culture of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. But why have people felt the need to frame things as Nordic and why has the adjective Nordic become so prominent? This book adopts a rhetorical approach, analysing the speech acts which have shaped the meanings of the term. What do the different terms Nordic and Scandinavian have in common, and how have the uses of these terms changed in different historical periods? What accounts for the apparent upsurge in uses of the rhetoric of Nordicness in the 2010s? Drawing on eight case studies of the uses of Nordic and Scandinavian from the nineteenth century to the present day, the book explores the appeal and the flexibility of the rhetoric of Nordicness, in relation to race, openness, gender equality, food, crime fiction, Nordic co-operation and the Nordic model. Arguing that ‘Nordic’ and ‘Scandinavian’ are flexible and contested concepts that have been used in different, often contradictory and inherently political ways, the book suggests that the usage of the term has evolved from a means of creating a cultural community, to forging political co-operation and further to marketing models in politics and popular culture. The rhetorical approach also shows how many of the hallmarks of Nordic political culture, such as the Nordic model, Nordic gender equality or Nordic openness are more recent conceptualisations than usually assumed. As such, the book argues for the need to turn attention away from analysing the different components of Nordicness into studying how, when, and for what purpose different features were made Nordic.",258.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2XBREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2XBREAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=493&source=gbs_api,From Scandinavianism to the Nordic Brand,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2XBREAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2XBREAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"Novalis, Signs of Revolution","[""William Arctander O'Brien""]","Novalis traces the meteoric career of one of the most striking--and most strikingly misunderstood--figures of German Romanticism. Although Friedrich von Hardenberg (better known by his pseudonym, Novalis) published scarcely eighty pages of writings in his lifetime, his considerable fame and influence continued to spread long after his death in 1801. His posthumous reputation, however, was largely based on the myth manufactured by opportunistic editors, as Wm. Arctander O'Brien reveals in this book, the first to extract Hardenberg from the distortions of history. A member of the generation of the 1770s that included Hegel, Hölderlin, and Schelling, Hardenberg was an avid follower of the French Revolution, a semiotician avant la lettre, and a prescient critic of religion. Yet in 1802, only a year after his death, the writer who had scandalized the Prussian court was marketed to a nation at war as a reactionary patriot, a sweet versifier of Idealism, and a morbid mystic. Identifying the break between Hardenberg's own early Romanticism and the late Romanticism that falsified it, Novalis shows us a writer fully engaged in revolutionary politics and examines his semiotic readings of philosophy and of the political, scientific, and religious institutions of the day. Drawing on the full range of Novalis's writings, including his poetry, notebooks, novels, and journals, O'Brien situates his semiotics between those of the eighteenth century and those of the twentieth and demonstrates the manner in which a concern for signs and language permeated all aspects of his thought. The most extensive study of Hardenberg available in English, Novalis makes this revolutionary theoretician visible for the first time. Mining a crucial chapter in the history of semiotics and social theory, it suggests fruitful, sometimes problematic connections between semiotic, historical, ""deconstructive,"" and philological practices as it presents a portrait of one of the most complex figures in literary history. Indispensable for scholars of German Romanticism, Novalis will also be of interest to students of comparative literature and European intellectual history.",392.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PWAPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PWAPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=508&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PWAPAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-PWAPAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Indigenous Knowledge and Education in Africa,['Chika Ezeanya-Esiobu'],"This open access book presents a strong philosophical, theoretical and practical argument for the mainstreaming of indigenous knowledge in curricula development, and in teaching and learning across the African continent. Since the dawn of political independence in Africa, there has been an ongoing search for the kind of education that will create a class of principled and innovative citizens who are sensitive to and committed to the needs of the continent. When indigenous or environment-generated knowledge forms the basis of learning in classrooms, learners are able to immediately connect their education with their lived reality. The result is much introspection, creativity and innovation across fields, sectors and disciplines, leading to societal transformation. Drawing on several theoretical assertions, examples from a wide range of disciplines, and experiences gathered from different continents at different points in history, the book establishes that for education to trigger the necessary transformation in Africa, it should be constructed on a strong foundation of learners’ indigenous knowledge. The book presents a distinct and uncharted pathway for Africa to advance sustainably through home-grown and grassroots based ideas, leading to advances in science and technology, growth of indigenous African business and the transformation of Africans into conscious and active participants in the continent’s progress. Indigenous Knowledge and Education in Africa is of interest to educators, entrepreneurs, policymakers, researchers and individuals engaged in finding sustainable and strategic solutions to regional and global advancement.",115.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3waWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=3waWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=516&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3waWDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3waWDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

A Typological Perspective on Latvian Grammar,['Andra Kalnaca'],"Theoretical studies of Latvian grammar have a great deal to offer to contemporary linguistics. Although traditionally Lithuanian has been the most widely studied Baltic language in diachronic and synchronic linguistics alike, Latvian has a number of distinctive features that can prove valuable both for historical, and perhaps even more so, for synchronic language research. Therefore, at the very least, contemporary typological, areal, and language contact studies involving Baltic languages should account for data from Latvian. Typologically, Latvian grammar is a classic Indo-European (Baltic) system with well-developed inflection and derivation. However, it also bears certain similarities to the Finno-Ugric languages, which can be reasonably explained by its areal and historical background. This applies, for example, to the mood system and its connections with modality and evidentiality in Latvian, also to the correlation between aspect and quantity as manifested in verbal and nominal (case) forms. The relations between debitive mood, certain constructions with reflexive verbs, and voice in Latvian are intriguing examples of unusual morphosyntactic features. Accordingly, the book focuses on the following topics: case system and declension (with emphasis on the polyfunctionality of case forms), gender, conjugation, tense and personal forms, aspect, mood, modality and evidentiality, reflexive verbs, and voice. The examples included in this book have been taken from the Balanced Corpus of Modern Latvian (Lidzsvarots musdienu latviešu valodas tekstu korpuss, available at www.korpuss.lv), www.google.lv, mass media, and fiction texts (see the List of language sources) without regard to relative frequency ratios.",198.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z50oCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=z50oCQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Historical+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=524&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z50oCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-z50oCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Ivanhoe,['Walter Scott'],"The fifth novel in Scott's Waverley series, Ivanhoe has become a timeless classic for all readers. The novel follows the story of the Saxon Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is disinherited by his father for supporting King Richard (a Norman) and in love with Lady Rowena. In one of the most famous scenes in literature, Ivanhoe participates in a jousting tournament. It is here that Scott introduces Locksley, better known as Robin Hood, to the story as a champion archer. Critics give Scott credit for introducing a Robin Hood that is more of a noble outlaw than a criminal. Interestingly, critics have postulated that the main female character, Rebecca, was modeled after Rebecca Gratz, the first female Jewish college student in the United States. The novel is also attributed to starting a revival of interest in the Middle Ages, creating the well-known bizarre relationship between King Richard and Prince John, and introducing the word ""freelance"" into the English language.",768.0,['Anglo-Saxons'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4j4YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4j4YAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Romance&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=118&source=gbs_api,A Romance,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4j4YAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-4j4YAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Morien,['Jessie Laidlay Weston'],"Excerpt: ...and all had sworn an oath that they would lead Sir Gawain to the cross-roads, at the entering in of their land for the greater shaming of King Arthur's Court. To this had they pledged themselves, that they would there slay him without respite or delay; and were it not that 'twere shame to themselves, and too great dishonour to one who bare the name of knight, they had hung him by the neck, on the border of the two lands, to shame King Arthur; so that all his folk who were of the knightly order, and dwelt at his court, and sought for adventure, should shun their land when they heard the tidings of the vengeance wrought by them upon knights-errant who would prove their fate within those borders. Thus it fell out that they brought Sir Gawain on the horse, sorely wounded and mishandled, within the nearness of half a mile, so that the knight knew he was nigh to the cell of the Hermit of whom at that self-same cross-road he had asked tidings of King Arthur's knights, and of that bad and evil land where many were brought to shame. And they who had brought him thither were of one mind that they should make a wheel, and break the knight upon it at the Cross by the parting of the ways whereof I have told ye afore. Now shall I leave speaking of this matter till I come again thereto, and will forthwith tell ye how it fared with Morien when the three had parted asunder, as I told ye afore (Sir Gawain, Morien, and Sir Lancelot, he was the third), since they would fain make proof of that which the Hermit had told them. Now will I tell ye of Morien ere that I end the tale of Sir Gawain. Now doth the adventure tell that Morien, that bold knight, rode the seaward way, and came safely to the passage of the ford nigh unto the open sea. And all the day he met no man of whom he might ask concerning his father; 'twas labour wasted, for all who saw him fled from him.

The languages of Malta,['Albert Gatt'],"The purpose of this volume is to present a snapshot of the state of the art of research on the languages of the Maltese islands, which include spoken Maltese, Maltese English and Maltese Sign Language. Malta is a tiny, but densely populated country, with over 422,000 inhabitants spread over only 316 square kilometers. It is a bilingual country, with Maltese and English enjoying the status of official languages. Maltese is a descendant of Arabic, but due to the history of the island, it has borrowed extensively from Sicilian, Italian and English. Furthermore, local dialects still coexist alongside the official standard language. The status of English as a second language dates back to British colonial rule, and just as in other former British colonies, a characteristic Maltese variety of English has developed. To these languages must be added Maltese Sign Language, which is the language of the Maltese Deaf community. This was recently recognised as Malta’s third official language by an act of Parliament in 2016. While a volume such as the present one can hardly do justice to all aspects of a diverse and complex linguistic situation, even in a small community like that of Malta, our aim in editing this book was to shed light on the main strands of research being undertaken in the Maltese linguistic context. Six of the contributions in this book focus on Maltese and explore a broad range of topics including: historical changes in the Maltese sound system; syllabification strategies; the interaction of prosody and gesture; the constraints regulating /t/-insertion; the productivity of derivational suffixes; and raising phenomena. The study of Maltese English, especially with the purpose of establishing the defining characteristics of this variety of English, is a relatively new area of research. Three of the papers in this volume deal with Maltese English, which is explored from the different perspectives of rhythm, the syntax of nominal phrases, and lexical choice. The last contribution discusses the way in which Maltese Sign Language (LSM) has evolved alongside developments in LSM research. In summary, we believe the present volume has the potential to present a unique snapshot of a complex linguistic situation in a geographically restricted area. Given the nature and range of topics proposed, the volume will likely be of interest to researchers in both theoretical and comparative linguistics, as well as those working with experimental and corpus-based methodologies. Our hope is that the studies presented here will also serve to pave the way for further research on the languages of Malta, encouraging researchers to also take new directions, including the exploration of variation and sociolinguistic factors which, while often raised as explanatory constructs in the papers presented here, remain under-researched.",317.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyVTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RyVTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&dq=Romance&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=495&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Other Women's Lib,['Julia C. Bullock'],"The Other Women’s Lib provides the first systematic analysis of Japanese literary feminist discourse of the 1960s—a full decade before the ""women’s lib"" movement emerged in Japan. It highlights the work of three well-known female fiction writers of this generation (Kono Taeko, Takahashi Takako, and Kurahashi Yumiko) for their avant-garde literary challenges to dominant models of femininity. Focusing on four tropes persistently employed by these writers to protest oppressive gender stereotypes—the disciplinary masculine gaze, feminist misogyny, ""odd bodies,"" and female homoeroticism—Julia Bullock brings to the fore their previously unrecognized theoretical contributions to second-wave radical feminist discourse. In all of these narrative strategies, the female body is viewed as both the object and instrument of engendering. Severing the discursive connection between bodily sex and gender is thus a primary objective of the narratives and a necessary first step toward a less restrictive vision of female subjectivity in modern Japan. The Other Women’s Lib further demonstrates that this ""gender trouble"" was historically embedded in the socioeconomic circumstances of the high-growth economy of the 1960s, when prosperity was underwritten by an increasingly conservative gendered division of labor that sought to confine women within feminine roles. Raised during the war to be ""good wives and wise mothers"" yet young enough to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them by Occupation-era reforms, the authors who fueled the 1960s boom in women’s literary publication staunchly resisted normative constructions of gender, crafting narratives that exposed or subverted hegemonic discourses of femininity that relegated women to the negative pole of a binary opposition to men. Their fictional heroines are unapologetically bad wives and even worse mothers; they are often wanton, excessive, or selfish and brazenly cynical with regard to traditional love, marriage, and motherhood. The Other Women’s Lib affords a cogent and incisive analysis of these texts as feminist philosophy in fictional form, arguing persuasively for the inclusion of such literary feminist discourse in the broader history of Japanese feminist theoretical development. It will be accessible to undergraduate audiences and deeply stimulating to scholars and others interested in gender and culture in postwar Japan, Japanese women writers, or Japanese feminism.",217.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZVrGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZVrGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Gender and Body in Japanese Women's Fiction,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZVrGDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZVrGDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

“My Soul Is A Witness”,['Carol Henderson'],"This special collection assembles some of the most pre-eminent scholars in the field in African, African American, and American Studies to explore the ways writers reclaim the Black female body in African American literature using the theoretical, social, cultural, and religious frameworks of spirituality and religion. Central to these discussions is Black women’s agency within these realms—their uncanny ability to invent and reinvent themselves within individual and communal spaces that frame them as both outsider and insider, unworthy and worthy, deviant and sacred, excess and minimal. Scholars have sought to discuss these tensions, acknowledged and affirmed in prose, poetry, music, essays, speeches, written plays, or short stories. Forgiveness, healing, redemption, and reclamation provide entry into these vibrant explorations of self-discovery, passion, and self-creation that interrogate traditional views of what is spiritual and what is religious.

Cultural Perspectives on Aging,['Andrea Hülsen-Esch'],"Current demographic developments and change due to long life expectancies, low birth rates, changing family structures, and economic and political crises causing migration and flight are having a significant impact on intergenerational relationships, the social welfare system, the job market and what elderly people (can) expect from their retirement and environment. The socio-political relevance of the categories of ‘age’ and ‘ageing’ have been increasing and gaining much attention within different scholarly fields. However, none of the efforts to identify age-related diseases or the processes of ageing in order to develop suitable strategies for prevention and therapy have had any effect on the fact that attitudes against the elderly are based on patterns that are determined by parameters that or not biological or sociological: age(ing) is also a cultural fact. This book reveals the importance of cultural factors in order to build a framework for analyzing and understanding cultural constructions of ageing, bringing together scholarly discourses from the arts and humanities as well as social, medical and psychological fields of study. The contributions pave the way for new strategies of caring for elderly people.",177.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQ5QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RQ5QEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT138&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=82&source=gbs_api,A Different Approach to Old Age and Aging,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Besides prose, it also considers poetry and theatrical plays from 1943 through 2018. An introduction to the historical events and cultural developments in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Czech, and Slovak Republic, and their impact on the artistic output helps to contextualise the motif changes and fictional strategies that authors have been applying for decades.

If God is male then the male is God - PULP FICTIONS No.3,['Karin van Marle'],"If God is male then the male is God - PULP FICTIONS No.3 Edited by Karin van Marle 2007 ISSN: 1992-5174 Pages: 17 Print version: Available Electronic version: Free PDF available About the publication God sometimes you just don’t come through. God sometimes you just don’t come through. Do you need a woman to look after you. God sometimes you just don’t come through ... Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall. Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky. (Tori Amos, ‘God’ Under the pink (1994)) In this edition of Pulp fiction(s) the contentious issues of ‘Women and the gender of God’ and ‘Women and religion’ are discussed by two prominent theologians, Frances Klopper (Unisa) and Dirk Human (UP). Klopper and Human presented their views earlier this year at a Gender Forum of the University of Pretoria Institute for Women’s and Gender Studies. Klopper exposes the pervasive maleness of Christianity resulting from fundamentalist interpretations of the Bible and from male imagery and symbols. Feminist biblical/theological scholars, like herself, aim to deconstruct biblical texts and images to disclose multiple possibilities of meaning and representation. Human describes the ‘broken reality’ reflected by many religions in which women are invisible, inferior and subordinate. Focusing primarily on the Jewish and Christian traditions as portrayed by the two creation stories in Genesis 1 and 2 he argues for ‘a balanced gender interpretation.’ In light of the continuing sexual violence and discrimination against women these perspectives urges us to reconsider women’s position in society. In the face of constitutional protection of equality, women’s rights and other laws protecting women, women still live in what Human calls ‘broken realities’. Patriarchy as a system of oppression is as forceful in private and public lives as ever. Pulp fiction(s) as a series interested in all issues regarding the tensions and transformations of societies, particularly postapartheid society, gladly creates space for the discourse on women, religion and the gender of God to continue.

Even as 'Autumn Love' lets woman discover the marital void in her life, 'A Touchy Affair' makes her amenable to her man's other woman. Just as 'Love's How's That' inflames woman's old flame, 'A Hearty Turn' brings her innate lesbian leanings to the fore.

Eva - A Novel by Carry van Bruggen,['Carry van Bruggen'],"Eva, a 1927 novel by Dutch writer Carry van Bruggen, is an experiment in depicting a woman’s life from girlhood to marriage, and beyond, to sexual freedom and independence. At the same time, the narrative expresses Eva’s dawning sense of self and expanding subjectivity through a stream of consciousness told by a shifting narrator. Burdened all of her life by feelings of shame, at the end of the novel Eva overcomes this legacy of her upbringing and declares that it is ‘bodily desire that makes love acceptable’. Carry van Bruggen’s rich and varied language conveys Eva’s experience of the world. Powerful memories of an orthodox Jewish childhood pervade the novel with its fluid sense of time. As Eva puts it, ‘I let these years slip through my fingers like a stream of dry, glinting sand.’ Jane Fenoulhet makes this important modernist novel accessible to English readers for the first time. While it can be described as a becoming-woman of both Eva and her creator, so can the translation be seen as the translator’s own becoming, as Fenoulhet explains in the accompanying commentary, where she also describes the challenges of translating van Bruggen’s dynamic, intense narrative. For Fenoulhet, translation is more a matter of personal engagement with the novel than a matter of word choice and style. In this way, the emotional and intellectual life of the main character is re-enacted through translation.",192.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7bEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Q7bEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=138&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q7bEDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Q7bEDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Discourses on Nations and Identities,['Daniel Syrovy'],"The third volume of the collected papers of the ICLA congress ""The Many Languages of Comparative Literature"" includes contributions that focus on the interplay between concepts of nation, national languages, and individual as well as collective identities. Because all literary communication happens within different kinds of power structures - linguistic, economic, political -, it often results in fascinating forms of hybridity. In the first of four thematic chapters, the papers investigate some of the ways in which discourses can establish modes of thinking, or how discourses are in turn controlled by active linguistic interventions, whether in the context of the patriarchy, war, colonialism, or political factions. The second thematic block is predominantly concerned with hybridity as an aspect of modern cultural identity, and the cultural and linguistic dimensions of domestic life and in society at large. Closely related, a third series of papers focuses on writers and texts analysed from the vantage points of exile and exophony, as well as theoretical contributions to issues of terminology and what it means to talk about transcultural phenomena. Finally, a group of papers sheds light on more overtly violent power structures, mechanisms of exclusion, Totalitarianism, torture, and censorship, but also resistance to these forms of oppression. In addition to these chapters, the volume also collects a number of thematically related group sections from the ICLA congress, preserving their original context.",612.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=39MWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=39MWEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA285&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=139&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Novel Districts,"['Kristina Malmio', 'Mia Österlund']","Finland-Swedish writer Monika Fagerholm is one of the most important contemporary Nordic authors. Her experimental, puzzling and daring novels, such as Underbara kvinnor vid vatten (1994) and Den amerikanska flickan (2004), have attracted much critical attention. She has won several literary awards, including the Nordic prize from the Swedish Academy in 2016; her works have travelled across national and cultural borders as they have now been translated in USA, Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. Fagerholm’s wild and visionary depictions of girlhood have long had an impact on the Nordic literary landscape; currently, she has many literary followers among young female writers and readers in Finland and Sweden. Novel Districts. Critical Readings of Monika Fagerholm is the first major study of Fagerholm’s works. In this edited volume, literary scholars explore the central themes and features that permeate Fagerholm’s works and introduce novel ways to understand and interpret her writings. The book begins with an introduction to her life, letters and the minority literature context of her writing and briefly describes the scholarship on Fagerholm’s works. After that, Finnish and Swedish scholars and experts on Fagerholm scrutinize her oeuvre in the light of up-to-date literary theory. The insights, theories and concepts of gender, feminist and girlhood studies as well as narratology, poststructuralism, posthumanism and reception studies are tested in close readings of Fagerholm’s works published between 1990 and 2012. Thus, the volume enhances and deepens the understanding of Fagerholm’s fiction and invites the attention of readers not yet familiar with her work. The articles demonstrate the multitude of ways in which literary and cultural conventions can be innovatively re-employed within 20th and 21th century literature to reveal new perspectives on contemporary Finnish and Nordic literature and ongoing cultural and social developments.",262.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gP1vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gP1vEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=246&source=gbs_api,Critical Readings of Monika Fagerholm,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gP1vEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gP1vEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The story first appeared in print as a 40-week serial in the National Era, a weekly abolitionist periodical, beginning in June of 1851. When it proved popular, Beecher Stowe decided to publish a full-length book, which quickly fanned the flames of the slavery debate, galvanized the abolitionist movement andignited passions on both sides. Though the greeting is apocryphal,Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have said upon meeting Beecher Stowe after the start of the Civil War, So, this is the little lady who made this big war.The novel features Tom, an enslaved black man of tremendous faith who, along with the other characters, struggles with the evils of slavery in the American South.

What They Did to the Kid,['Jack Fritscher'],"""What They Did to the Kid"" is a memoir spinning as a comic novel for general-fiction readers intrigued by boys' school tales, and baby boomers who ""survived Catholic school."" Ryan O'Hara, coming of age from 14 to 24, is the wise adolescent narrating readers' entry into the secret culture of 1950's altar boys who go to the seminary, meet priests, and must decide their own identities. The novel's interior ticking covers the clock and calendar of boys' emerging consciences and edgy consciousness. ""The San Francisco Chronicle"" says, ""Jack Fritscher reads gloriously."" Strong characters and snappy dialog propel the character-driven plot of male-dominant pecking order. At Misericordia Seminary (aptly nicknamed ""Misery""), Ryan O'Hara exposes his own story. He's trapped for oxygen-with 500 other boys-by the imperial Rector Karg, the disciplinarian Father Gunn ""of the USMC,"" the tart Father Polistina, and the rebel-priest Chris Dryden ""who knows Fellini and JFK."" The storytelling Irish-American author gives each ensemble character-hero or villain, student or priest, man or woman-a rich back story. Black civil rights of the 60's as well as three interesting women characters open this tale out of the suffocating seminary and on to the hot streets of Chicago's South Side and Old Town. The compelling psychological drama hinges on the very source and aspirations of priestly vocation versus self-esteem. ""Is God calling me-and what about chastity? Or is it just the 'Bali Hai' of blind ambition and social climbing-and what about sex?"" Fritscher makes deeper than usual sense of soulful coming-of-age material. The hearty supply of boarding school episodes cumulatively reveals the dueling dynamic between the boyish protagonist, Ryan O'Hara, and the callous ambition of the handsome bully, Tank Rimsky, as they fight toward the finish line of ""manly men's"" ordination to the priesthood. ""The hardest thing to be in America today is a man."" The novel is based on an under-reported story: the Catholic Church recruited 200,000 boys into seminaries in the 1950's. Only 20,000 were ordained. ""Kid"" details, in a nostalgic and not unkind take what happened to the missing 180,000 boys and the women and men in their families. Daring to step inside Catholic culture, without being parochial, this American story reveals the 1950's roots of 21st-century ""recovering Catholic"" panic and angst. The millions of post-Catholic baby boomers who have exited the Church will compare notes and laugh knowingly at the dead-on characterizations. Fashionably anti-Catholic campers will say, ""but, of course "" Readers might catalog ""Kid"" in the genre of ""Young Torless, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" Before now, no one of the surviving 180,000 ex-seminarians has dared reveal this insider confession on the secret milieu of the Catholic education of priests. From interviews with more than a hundred former seminarians, Jack Fritscher uniquely stages their true story arcs with wit, verve, and comedy. ""What They Did to the Kid"" is the fourth novel from Jack Fritscher whose twelve books have sold more than 100,000 copies. Jack Fritscher is a graduate of the prestigious Pontifical College Josephinum, a Roman Catholic seminary, located in Columbus, Ohio, and directly subject to the Vatican in Rome. He received his doctorate in American Literature from Loyola University, Chicago.",373.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WfVrCYWejtkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WfVrCYWejtkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=375&source=gbs_api,Confessions of an Altar Boy,No link available

I Know This Much Is True,['Wally Lamb'],"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",914.0,['Fiction'],4.0,103.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=380&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&rdid=book-v9uqxTiOxq8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Maternal Fictions,['Maryline Lukacher'],"Stendhal, George Sand, Rachilde, Georges Bataille: Forgoing the patronym, with its weight of meaning, these modern French writers renamed themselves in their work. Their use of pseudonyms, as Maryline Lukacher demonstrates in this provocative study, is part of a process to subvert the name of the father and explore the suppressed relation to the figure of the mother. Combining psychoanalytic criticism, feminist theory, and literary analysis, Maternal Fictions offers a complex psychological portrait of these writers who managed at once to challenge patriarchal authority and at the same time attempt to return to the maternal. Through readings of Armance, Le Rouge et le noir, La Vie de Henry Brulard, and Les Cenci, Lukacher exposes Stendhal's preoccupation with his dead mother, who is obsessively retrieved throughout his work. George Sand's identity is, in effect, divided between two mothers, her biological mother and her grandmother, and in Histoire de ma vie, Indiana, and Mauprat, we see the writer's efforts to break the impasse created by this divided identity. In the extraordinary but too little known work of Rachilde (Marguerite Eymery), Lukacher finds the maternal figure identified as the secret inner force of patriarchal oppression. This resistance to feminism continues in the pseudonymous work of Georges Bataille. In Ma mère, Le coupable, and L'Expérience intérieure Lukacher traces Bataille's representation of the mother as a menacing, ever subversive figure who threatens basic social configurations. Maternal Fictions establishes a new pseudonymous genealogy in modern French writing that will inform and advance our understanding of the act of self-creation that occurs in fiction.",240.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lWlcAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lWlcAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=384&source=gbs_api,"Stendhal, Sand, Rachilde, and Bataille",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lWlcAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-lWlcAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Reading Today,"['Heta Pyrhönen', 'Janna Kantola']","New technologies are changing our reading habits. Laptops, e-readers, tablets and other handheld devices supply new platforms for reading, and we must learn to manage them by scrolling, clicking or tapping. Reading Today places reading in current literary and cultural contexts in order to analyse how these contexts challenge our conceptions of who reads, what reading is, how we read, where we read, and for what purposes – and then responds to the questions this analysis raises. Is our reading experience becoming a ‘flat’ one? And does reading in a media environment favour quick reading? Alongside these questions, the contributors unpack emerging strategies of reading.They consider, for example, how paying attention to readers’ emotional reactions as an indispensable component of reading affects our conception of the reading process.

"Socialist Feminism: The First Decade, 1966-76",['Gloria Martin'],"Records the forging of the first Marxist feminist party in history -- the Freedom Socialist Party. Set in the tumultuous upsurges of the 1960s and '70s, Gloria Martin vividly describes the eruption of the women's liberation movement amidst the antiwar and civil rights struggles. Martin documents early lesbian and gay coalitions, the fight to legalize abortion in Washington State, radical labor organizing, community mobilizations against police brutality and poverty, campus upsurges, and the growth of the FSP's sister organization, Radical Women. She scathingly critiques the role of the Socialist Workers Party and other Left groups typified by sexism and opportunism. To them, she contrasts the Freedom Socialist Party's multi-issue focus on reaching those most oppressed as workingclass people of color, women, and sexual minorities. From the on-the-ground perspective of a seasoned organizer, Martin probes with a sharp scalpel the internal conflicts in the movements for social change. This is a story of years of intense work by radical women and men. It is a chronicle, a reference, an analysis, a judgment, and a guidebook. Its central message is inescapable: socialist feminism as a theme and strategy has never been more urgently needed than it is today.",252.0,['Social Science'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a9XIsiVh5joC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a9XIsiVh5joC&pg=PP1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=449&source=gbs_api,,No link available

She takes the signs of the ancient goddess - the lotus, the sacred grove, the serpent, the sacrifice - and uses them in astonishing new ways. Her story is one of suffering and great trials, and through it all an unquenchable longing to be free. This beautifully illustrated work is as layered and subversive as mythology itself. Based directly on authentic Buddhist texts, and informed with insights from psychology and comparative mythology, it takes a fresh look at how Buddhist women have been depicted by men and how they have depicted themselves.",562.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4oO4sAlJKBgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4oO4sAlJKBgC&pg=PP1&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=467&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Trapped by Political Desire,['Matt Erickson'],"After decades of failing to reach his fellow conservatives, it was time for Will Hartline to try something radical enough to get noticed. So, he decided to advance a plan that appeared highly favorable to his political adversaries—the men and women who supported Big Government. His Political Year Strategy was brilliantly simple—it merely called for Congress to change Election Day to February 29th. Once the election date changed, then “Year’ (as it related to elections and elected federal terms) could become the interval of time until the designated day used for elections again showed up on the calendar. Suddenly, it would appear that Presidents could serve four “Political Years”—16 calendar years—while Representatives could serve two political years (8 calendar years) and Senators six political years (24 calendar years). But, as his political adversaries sought implement his strategy—so they could extend their political terms four-fold—they wouldn’t notice that were simultaneously building Will the name recognition and political platform he had never been able to build himself. And, once he found his political voice, he would spring his trap, that he had baited with the promise of extended political terms. In other words, Will’s Political Year Strategy would advance Big Government so far, it would ultimately expose to the bright light of day the underlying fallacy of 200 years of the Supreme Court reinterpretation.

The Tale of Genji,"['John T. Carpenter', 'Melissa McCormick', 'Monika Bincsik', 'Kyoko Kinoshita', 'Sano Midori']","With its vivid descriptions of courtly society, gardens, and architecture in early eleventh-century Japan, The Tale of Genji—recognized as the world’s first novel—has captivated audiences around the globe and inspired artistic traditions for one thousand years. Its female author, Murasaki Shikibu, was a diarist, a renowned poet, and, as a tutor to the young empress, the ultimate palace insider; her monumental work of fiction offers entry into an elaborate, mysterious world of court romance, political intrigue, elite customs, and religious life. This handsomely designed and illustrated book explores the outstanding art associated with Genji through in-depth essays and discussions of more than one hundred works. The Tale of Genji has influenced all forms of Japanese artistic expression, from intimately scaled albums to boldly designed hanging scrolls and screen paintings, lacquer boxes, incense burners, games, palanquins for transporting young brides to their new homes, and even contemporary manga. The authors, both art historians and Genji scholars, discuss the tale’s transmission and reception over the centuries; illuminate its place within the history of Japanese literature and calligraphy; highlight its key episodes and characters; and explore its wide-ranging influence on Japanese culture, design, and aesthetics into the modern era. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Verdana}",371.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XHOKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XHOKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=484&source=gbs_api,A Japanese Classic Illuminated,No link available

Impressions of Arabia,['Thierry mauger'],"With its awe-inspiring landmarks, its dense woodlands, and the delightful coolness of its mountain tops, the region of Asir stands in sharp contrast to the usual patterns of Saudi Arabian landscape. “This could have been the site of the Garden of Eden,” wrote St. John Philby in the 1930s, and as this extraordinary book of photographs demonstrates, the claim still holds true today. The story of the author’s two journeys around the Asir region is told through the architecture, frescoes and lifestyles of the people. Granted royal approval for his second project, Thierry Mauger has been able to gain access to previously unseen interiors and to win the trust of the people. In the process, he reveals how the art of the Asir region, the hand-painted, brightly colored interior decoration, the painted facades, the symbolism of the architecture, and the unique landscape form a complex code which provides valuable insights into understanding this little-known culture. In the midst of Westernizing trends, the author demonstrates the strong traditional forces which imbue the art and architecture of Asir today. New architecture is taking up forms and ornamentation from traditional regional styles, and as the author shows, the painted interiors by Asiri women resonate with the traditions of magic and religion, blended with new images drawn from the contemporary culture. الأبواب الألواح الألوان التقليدي الجدار الدرج الرسام الزخارف الطراز الطين الفن الكوارتز المعماري المملكة العربية السعودية المنازل

The real Richard is famous as one of the two young ""princes in the tower"" whose fate is lost in history. Because of the mysterious situation of the tower, it was unclear whether Richard had died or not. As a result, along with a movement to overthrow King Henry VII, Warbeck gained several prominent followers. He became a legitimate threat to King Henry VII and the Tudor dynasty.

The five country studies show how research on the extent of, and the motivations and conditions for, young people selling sex in the Nordic countries is rather scarce and that there are few social initiatives that target young people specifically.

Introducing Vigilant Audiences,"['Daniel Trottier', 'Rashid Gabdulhakov', 'Qian Huang']","Ever since the exposure of the Kitten Killer of Hangshou captured the imagination of online communities world-wide, vigilantism and digilantism has come to the fore as an emerging and poignant issue. In their book Introducing Vigilant Audiences Daniel Trottier and colleagues (and contributors) have produced an excellent and throughtful ‘must read’ for all who are studying vigilantism, or just interested in it. Prof. David Wall, University of Leeds This is a collection of cutting edge and thoughtful case studies of global digital vigilantism that advances this emerging and increasingly important field in useful and intriguing ways. Prof. Michael Pfeifer, City University of New York This ground-breaking collection of essays examines the scope and consequences of digital vigilantism – a phenomenon emerging on a global scale, which sees digital audiences using social platforms to shape social and political life. Longstanding forms of moral scrutiny and justice seeking are disseminated through our contemporary media landscape, and researchers are increasingly recognising the significance of societal impacts effected by digital media. The authors engage with a range of cross-disciplinary perspectives in order to explore the actions of a vigilant digital audience – denunciation, shaming, doxing – and to consider the role of the press and other public figures in supporting or contesting these activities. In turn, the volume illuminates several tensions underlying these justice seeking activities – from their capacity to reproduce categorical forms of discrimination, to the diverse motivations of the wider audiences who participate in vigilant denunciations. This timely volume presents thoughtful case studies drawn both from high-profile Anglo-American contexts, and from developments in regions that have received less coverage in English-language scholarship. It is distinctive in its focus on the contested boundary between policing and entertainment, and on the various contexts in which the desire to seek retribution converges with the desire to consume entertainment. Introducing Vigilant Audiences will be of great value to researchers and students of sociology, politics, criminology, critical security studies, and media and communication. It will be of further interest to those who wish to understand recent cases of citizen-led justice seeking in their global context.",360.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qccDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qccDEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT117&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=9&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qccDEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qccDEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Sex, Gender and Substance Use",['Lorraine Greaves'],"“Sex, Gender and Substance Use” describes how both biological and social factors affect people's use of substances. There is a lot of research carried out on substance use, prevention and treatment in which sex and gender are missing. This book describes the concepts of sex and gender, what they mean and why including them in substance use research, practice and policy is vital. Substances such as alcohol, drugs, nicotine, and tobacco all have differential effects on females and males. Social and cultural gendered factors affect how women and men react to prevention, treatment and policies. The book includes numerous examples of how sex- and gender-sensitive research can increase our understanding and improve prevention and treatment, and why striving for gender-transformative substance use practice and research remains a gold standard.",272.0,['Medical'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5zspEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5zspEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA186&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Fernal Songs,['Bruce Rimell'],"What would a positive, life-affirming, cosmos-embracing and transcendent Queer mythology look like? In the years 2013-15, artist and poet Bruce Rimell got a chance to find out when he was invited to participate in a collaborative project to create an international art publication, ‘The Encyclopaedia of Fernal Affairs’. Although this was principally an art-oriented initiative, Bruce quickly went off on his own tangent, inventing a complete constructed language and two song-cycles of fernal mythology which resonated with his own burgeoning sense of his Queer identity. ‘The Fernal Songs’ are the shimmering results of that literary side project. Centred around Lucaion, a Queer Hero whose exploits around an animistic cosmos showcase a more compassionate, interactive masculine images than the traditional subduer of enemies, and Afer, an all-gendered Cosmic Creatrix, whose song reverberates across the Fernal World, these are sacred songs which move beyond satirical ‘queering’ of traditional religious forms into a transcendent queer space which simultaneously resonates with ancient memories and indigenous lifeways as well as with possible queer futures of intense beauty and humanism. The ‘Song of Lucaion’, the ‘Thirteen Songs’ and the supplemental ‘Daiarzan’ come with several essays, personal recollections and honest expressions of Bruce’s envisioning of what he calls the ‘sacred and pristine jewel of queeritude within.’",186.0,['Poetry'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u_iVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u_iVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=12&source=gbs_api,,No link available
There is a Crack in Everything—Education and Religion in a Secular Age,['K. H.

Each age has had its debate about modernizing forces that drive concerns of impending secularization. In this publication this theme is approached from perspectives of teachers, of students, of policy makers and situated in a politico-historical context.

Leaving a Violent Relationship,['Adele Jones'],"Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse and controlling behaviors inflicted within intimate partner relationships, is a global crisis that extends beyond national and sociocultural boundaries, affecting people of all ages, religions, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds. Though studies exist that seek to explain how people become trapped within violent relationships and what factors facilitate survival, escape and safety, this book provides fresh insights into this complex and multifaceted issue. People often ask of women in abusive relationships “why does she stay?” Critics suggest that this question carries implicit notions of victim blame and fails to hold to account the perpetrators of abuse. The studies described in this book, however, explore the question from the perspectives of survivors and represent a shift away from individual pathology to an approach based on the recognition of structural oppression, agency and resilience. Comprising eight chapters, new theoretical frameworks for the analysis of IPV are provided to guide practitioners and policy makers in improving services for vulnerable people in abusive relationships, and a range of studies into the experiences of a diverse range of survivors, including mothers in Portugal, women who experienced child marriage in Uganda, and refugees in the United States of America, generate findings which elucidate perspectives from marginalised and under-researched groups.",132.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_N8sEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_N8sEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA57&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=15&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Violent Affections,['Alexander Sasha Kondakov'],"Violent Affections uncovers techniques of power that work to translate emotions into violence against queer people. Based on analysis of over 300 criminal cases of anti-queer violence in Russia before and after the introduction of ‘gay propaganda’ law, the book shows how violent acts are framed in emotional language by perpetrators during their criminal trials. It then utilises an original methodology of studying ‘legal memes’ and argues that these individual affective states are directly connected to the political violence aimed at queer lives more generally. The main aim of Violent Affections is to explore the social mechanisms and techniques that impact anti-queer violence evidenced in the reviewed cases. Alexander Sasha Kondakov expands upon two sets of interdisciplinary literature – queer theory and affect theory – in order to conceptualise what is referred to as neo-disciplinary power. Taking the empirical observations from Russia as a starting point, he develops an original explanation of how contemporary power relations are changing from those of late modernity as envisioned by Foucault’s Panopticon to neo-disciplinary power relations of a much more fragmented, fluid and unstructured kind – the Memeticon. The book traces how exactly affections circulate from body to body as a kind of virus and eventually invade the body that responds with violence. In this analytic effort, it draws on the arguments from memetics – the theory of how pieces of information pass on from one body to another as they thrive to survive by continuing to resonate. This work makes the argument truly interdisciplinary.",246.0,['Social Science'],5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ovd-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ovd-EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA213&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=16&source=gbs_api,"Queer sexuality, techniques of power, and law in Russia",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ovd-EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Ovd-EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

It is a peer-reviewed, edited volume with scholarly contributions from lawyers, anthropologists, and LGBTIQ+ activists. It covers different country situations – those where equality is taking root, as the case is in South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique; those where homophobia reigns and LGBTIQ+ rights are politicised such as, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia; and those where traditional LGBTIQ+ activism is almost a nonstarter, such as in Ethiopia, Sudan and The Gambia.

Faith and Religiosity in Türkiye,['Zübeyir Nişancı'],"The Turkish Faith and Religiosity Survey (TFRS) was conducted between December 2021 and May 2022, with the aim of providing a comprehensive and consistent statistical understanding of the religious beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors prevalent in Türkiye. The survey was administered to a random sample of 1,942 individuals aged 18 and over in 12 regions, with representation from both rural and urban populations in proportion. The survey contained approximately 200 questions covering various dimensions of religious beliefs, attitudes, and practices, and the results are presented in the report through graphs, tables, and maps. The report provides insights into the distribution of religious beliefs and practices based on gender, age group, education level, rural-urban residence, and geographical region. The TFRS project had two main goals. The first goal was to achieve a more comprehensive and consistent methodological approach than previous studies in examining the statistical distribution of common beliefs and religious practices in Türkiye. The second goal was to evaluate the efficacy of new methods for collecting reliable data in large-scale sociological and statistical studies in Türkiye. To address the limitations of previous surveys, the TFRS survey questions were developed by the research team in consultation with academic experts, and efforts were made to avoid statements that could be perceived as challenging the participants' beliefs and attitudes, in order to minimize the likelihood of socially desirable responses. Innovative field application techniques, such as a self-administered questionnaire form, were developed to encourage participants to respond to survey questions comfortably and without pressure. The TFRS study offers the opportunity to generate novel and original statistical data on the religious beliefs, practices, and attitudes prevalent in Türkiye. The study demonstrates that highly representative data can be collected through voluntary methods, and highlights the potential of new technologies and methods, such as electronic applications and catchment area-based sampling methods, in collecting reliable data without sacrificing quality. The study also includes an online perception survey to assess the prevalence of common beliefs and practices related to religiosity throughout Türkiye, providing a comparison to the data collected in the field. The TFRS study provides important insights into the distribution of religious beliefs and practices in Türkiye, and offers valuable guidance for future large-scale sociological and statistical studies in the region",224.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_2K1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_2K1EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=24&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_2K1EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_2K1EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

COVID-19 in Southeast Asia,"['Hyun Bang Shin', 'Murray Mckenzie', 'Do Young Oh']","COVID-19 has presented huge challenges to governments, businesses, civil societies, and people from all walks of life, but its impact has been highly variegated, affecting society in multiple negative ways, with uneven geographical and socioeconomic patterns. The crisis revealed existing contradictions and inequalities in society, compelling us to question what it means to return to “normal” and what insights can be gleaned from Southeast Asia for thinking about a post-pandemic world. In this regard, this edited volume collects the informed views of an ensemble of social scientists – area studies, development studies, and legal scholars; anthropologists, architects, economists, geographers, planners, sociologists, and urbanists; representing academic institutions, activist and charitable organisations, policy and research institutes, and areas of professional practice – who recognise the necessity of critical commentary and engaged scholarship. These contributions represent a wide-ranging set of views, collectively producing a compilation of reflections on the following three themes in particular: (1) Urbanisation, digital infrastructures, economies, and the environment; (2) Migrants, (im)mobilities, and borders; and (3) Collective action, communities, and mutual action. Overall, this edited volume first aims to speak from a situated position in relevant debates to challenge knowledge about the pandemic that has assigned selective and inequitable visibility to issues, people, or places, or which through its inferential or interpretive capacity has worked to set social expectations or assign validity to certain interventions with a bearing on the pandemic’s course and the future it has foretold. Second, it aims to advance or renew understandings of social challenges, risks, or inequities that were already in place, and which, without further or better action, are to be features of our “post-pandemic world” as well. This volume also contributes to the ongoing efforts to de-centre and decolonise knowledge production. It endeavours to help secure a place within these debates for a region that was among the first outside of East Asia to be forced to contend with COVID-19 in a substantial way and which has evinced a marked and instructive diversity and dynamism in its fortunes.",342.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-GdkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-GdkEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA312&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=30&source=gbs_api,Insights for a post-pandemic world,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-GdkEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book--GdkEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Peace, Politics, and Religion",['Jeffrey Haynes'],"Relationships between peace, politics and religion are often controversial, and sometimes problematic. Religion is a core source of identity for billions of people around the world and it is hardly surprising that sometimes it becomes involved in conflicts. At the same time, we can see religion involved not only in conflict. It is also central to conflict resolution, peace-making and peacebuilding. Religious involvement is often necessary to try to end hatred and differences, frequently central to political conflicts especially, but not only, in the Global South. Evidence shows that religious leaders and faith-based organisations can play constructive roles in helping to end violence, and in some cases, build peace via early warnings of conflict, good offices once conflict has erupted, as well as advocacy, mediation and reconciliation. The chapters of this book highlight that religion can encourage both conflict and peace, through the activities of people individually and collectively imbued with religious ideas and ideals.",226.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tLgOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tLgOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA209&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=31&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Equality of Opportunity for Sexual and Gender Minorities,"['Clifton Cortez', 'John Arzinos', 'Christian De la Medina Soto']","Despite legal and social advances in the past two decades, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) people continue to face widespread discrimination and violence in many countries. This discrimination and violence lead to exclusion, which adversely impacts their lives, as well as the communities and economies in which they live. A major barrier to addressing this stigma and sexual orientation and gender identity-based exclusion is the lack of SOGI-specic data. Robust, quantitative data on diÂ‚erential development experiences and outcomes of sexual and gender minorities--especially those in developing countries--is extremely thin. This paucity of data jeopardizes the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and countries' commitment to the principle of 'leaving no one behind' in the effÂ‚ort to end poverty and inequality. 'Equality of Opportunity for Sexual and Gender Minorities' assesses the unique challenges that sexual and gender minorities face in six important areas: (i) Criminalization and SOGI (ii) Access to education (iii) Access to the labor market (iv) Access to public services and social protection (v) Civil and political inclusion (vi) Protection from hate crimes. This report covÂ‚ers numerous policy recommendations to prevent and eliminate discriminatory practices in all of the areas covered. It also seeks to infÂŽuence legislative changes and support research on institutions and regulations that can ultimately lead to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. At the same time, it acknowledges that the mere existence of inclusive laws and regulations does not ensure that sexual and gender minorities are free from discrimination--the enforcement of those laws is crucial. This publication, the Â first in a series of studies, will be expanded from the 16 countries included here to a wider set of countries for more in-depth quantitative analysis and to identify possible correlations with socioeconomic outcomes. It will seek to deepen knowledge, facilitate peer learning of good practices, and encourage reforms to increase the inclusion of sexual and gender minorities.",182.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FU9XEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FU9XEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=32&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FU9XEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FU9XEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The European Experience,"['Jan Hansen', 'Jochen Hung', 'Jaroslav Ira', 'Judit Klement', 'Sylvain Lesage', 'Juan Luis Simal', 'Andrew Tompkins']","The European Experience brings together the expertise of nearly a hundred historians from eight European universities to internationalise and diversify the study of modern European history, exploring a grand sweep of time from 1500 to 2000. Offering a valuable corrective to the Anglocentric narratives of previous English-language textbooks, scholars from all over Europe have pooled their knowledge on comparative themes such as identities, cultural encounters, power and citizenship, and economic development to reflect the complexity and heterogeneous nature of the European experience. Rather than another grand narrative, the international author teams offer a multifaceted and rich perspective on the history of the continent of the past 500 years. Each major theme is dissected through three chronological sub-chapters, revealing how major social, political and historical trends manifested themselves in different European settings during the early modern (1500–1800), modern (1800–1900) and contemporary period (1900–2000). This resource is of utmost relevance to today’s history students in the light of ongoing internationalisation strategies for higher education curricula, as it delivers one of the first multi-perspective and truly ‘European’ analyses of the continent’s past. Beyond the provision of historical content, this textbook equips students with the intellectual tools to interrogate prevailing accounts of European history, and enables them to seek out additional perspectives in a bid to further enrich the discipline.",767.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=212vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=212vEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT183&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=43&source=gbs_api,"A Multi-Perspective History of Modern Europe, 1500–2000",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=212vEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-212vEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Post Memes,"['Daniel Bristow', 'Alfie Bown']","Art-form, send-up, farce, ironic disarticulation, pastiche, propaganda, trololololol, mode of critique, mode of production, means of politicisation, even of subjectivation - memes are the inner currency of the internet's circulatory system. Independent of any one set value, memes are famously the mode of conveyance for the alt-right, the irony left, and the apoliticos alike, and they are impervious to many economic valuations: the attempts made in co-opting their discourse in advertising and big business have made little headway, and have usually been derailed by retaliative meming. POST MEMES: SEIZING THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION takes advantage of the meme's subversive adaptability and ripeness for a focused, in-depth study. Pulling together the interrogative forces of a raft of thinkers at the forefront of tech theory and media dissection, this collection of essays paves a way to articulating the semiotic fabric of the early 21st century's most prevalent means of content posting, and aims at the very seizing of the memes of production for the imagining and creation of new political horizons. With contributions from Scott and McKenzie Wark, Patricia Reed, Jay Owens, Thomas Hobson and Kaajal Modi, Dominic Pettman, Bogna M. Konior, and Eric Wilson, among others, this essay volume offers the freshest approaches available in the field of memes studies and inaugurates a new kind of writing about the newest manifestations of the written online. The book aims to become the go-to resource for all students and scholars of memes, and will be of the utmost interest to anyone interested in the internet's most viral phenomenon.

In doing so, they grapple with fundamental questions in education such as: how to meaningfully foreground democracy, partnership, and emotional care; the role and limits of free speech; and how to deconstruct enduring inequality and marginalisation. In a period of considerable change and challenge for education, there is surely no better time to be critically analysing the principles guiding our universities through the lens of real-life practice. ""In a period when university arrangements are being rethought in the wake of COVID-19 and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, this compelling text is both timely and forward looking. ‘We’re trying to do things differently’ successfully brings together first year undergraduates and lecturers to research, analyse and document how students and staff co-create meaningful educational experiences. The authors offer a nuanced picture of the centrality of relationships and recognition to the degree course. It shows how the students foreground love, kindness and social justice, rather than curriculum and outcomes, while being alert to the politics of difference and absence in higher education classrooms. The book draws on well-worn and innovative writing styles to produce analyses and arguments that are eye-opening, persuasive and raise difficult questions for future educational practices. This book is a must for anyone interested in championing excellence and social justice in higher education."" Ann Phoenix, Professor of Psychosocial Studies, UCL Institute of Education ""This is a book with a difference. It is based on critical scholarship and draws on reflexive analysis but – and this is the important and unique part - it is a book written mainly by university students about how to enact meaningful relationships in the academy. It takes as its substantive focus one new undergraduate programme but the agenda is about change, social justice and the hard work of real inclusion.

"Digital Objects, Digital Subjects","['David Chandler', 'Christian Fuchs']","This volume explores activism, research and critique in the age of digital subjects and objects and Big Data capitalism after a digital turn said to have radically transformed our political futures. Optimists assert that the ‘digital’ promises: new forms of community and ways of knowing and sensing, innovation, participatory culture, networked activism, and distributed democracy. Pessimists argue that digital technologies have extended domination via new forms of control, networked authoritarianism and exploitation, dehumanization and the surveillance society. Leading international scholars present varied interdisciplinary assessments of such claims – in theory and via dialogue – and of the digital’s impact on society and the potentials, pitfalls, limits and ideologies, of digital activism. They reflect on whether computational social science, digital humanities and ubiquitous datafication lead to digital positivism that threatens critical research or lead to new horizons in theory and society.

What Photographs Do,"['Elizabeth Edwards', 'Ella Ravilious']","What are photographs ‘doing’ in museums? Why are some photographs valued and others not? Why are some photographic practices visible and not others? What value systems and hierarchies do they reflect? What Photographs Do explores how museums are defined through their photographic practices. It focuses not on formal collections of photographs as accessioned objects, be they ‘fine art’ or ‘archival’, but on what might be termed ‘non-collections’: the huge number of photographs that are integral to the workings of museums yet ‘invisible’, existing outside the structures of ‘the collection’. These photographs, however, raise complex and ambiguous questions about the ways in which such accumulations of photographs create the values, hierarchies, histories and knowledge-systems, through multiple, folded and overlapping layers that might be described as the museum’s ecosystem. These photographic dynamics are studied through the prism of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, an institution with over 150 years' engagement with photography’s multifaceted uses and existences in the museum. The book differs from more usual approaches to museum studies in that it presents not only formal essays but short ‘auto-ethnographic’ interventions from museum practitioners, from studio photographers and image managers to conservators and non-photographic curators, who address the significance of both historical and contemporary practices of photography in their work. As such this book offers an extensive and unique range of accounts of what photographs ‘do’ in museums, expanding the critical discourse of both photography and museums.",357.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CFyYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CFyYEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA131&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=52&source=gbs_api,The making and remaking of museum cultures,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CFyYEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CFyYEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Rethinking Heritage for Sustainable Development,['Sophia Labadi'],"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN in 2015 have influenced the actions of international and intergovernmental organisations and governments around the world, and have dictated priorities for international aid spending. Culture, including heritage, is often presented as fundamental to addressing the SDGs: since 2010, the United Nations has adopted no fewer than five major policy recommendations that assert its importance as a driver and enabler of development. Yet, heritage is marginalized from the Sustainable Development Goals. Rethinking Heritage for Sustainable Development constitutes a substantial and original assessment of whether and how heritage has contributed to three key dimensions of sustainable development (namely poverty reduction, gender equality and environmental sustainability) within the context of its marginalisation from the Sustainable Development Goals and from previous international development agendas. Sophia Labadi adopts a novel, inclusive, large-scale and systematic approach, providing the first comprehensive history of the international approaches on culture (including heritage) for development, from 1970 to the present day. This book is also the first to assess the negative and positive impacts of all the international projects implemented in sub-Saharan Africa by a consortium of UN organisations that aimed to provide evidence for the contribution of heritage for development in time for the negotiation of the SDGs. The book’s conclusions provide recommendations for rethinking heritage for development, while reflecting on the major shortcomings of the selected projects.",256.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=20pvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=20pvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=54&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=20pvEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-20pvEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Queer Migration and Asylum in Europe,['Richard C. M. Mole'],"Europe is a popular destination for LGBTQ people seeking to escape discrimination and persecution. Yet, while European institutions have done much to promote the legal equality of sexual minorities and a number of states pride themselves on their acceptance of sexual diversity, the image of European tolerance and the reality faced by LGBTQ migrants and asylum seekers are often quite different. To engage with these conflicting discourses, Queer Migration and Asylum in Europe brings together scholars from politics, sociology, urban studies, anthropology and law to analyse how and why queer individuals migrate to or seek asylum in Europe, as well as the legal, social and political frameworks they are forced to navigate to feel at home or to regularise their status in the destination societies. The subjects covered include LGBTQ Latino migrants’ relationship with queer and diasporic spaces in London; diasporic consciousness of queer Polish, Russian and Brazilian migrants in Berlin; the role of the Council of Europe in shaping legal and policy frameworks relating to queer migration and asylum; the challenges facing bisexual asylum seekers; queer asylum and homonationalism in the Netherlands; and the role of space, faith and LGBTQ organisations in Germany, Italy, the UK and France in supporting queer asylum seekers.",276.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=efwhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=efwhEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=55&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=efwhEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-efwhEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
A Stage of Emancipation,"['Marguérite Corporaal', 'Ruud van den Beuken']","As the prominence of the recent #WakingTheFeminists movement illustrates, the Irish theatre world is highly conscious of the ways in which theatre can foster social emancipation. This volume of essays uncovers a wide range of marginalised histories by reflecting on the emancipatory role that the Dublin Gate Theatre (est. 1928) has played in Irish culture and society, both historically and in more recent times. The Gate's founders, Hilton Edwards and Mich�al mac Liamm�ir, promoted the work of many female playwrights and created an explicitly cosmopolitan stage on which repressive ideas about gender, sexuality, class and language were questioned. During Selina Cartmell's current tenure as director, cultural diversity and social emancipation have also featured prominently on the Gate's agenda, with various productions exploring issues of ethnicity in contemporary Ireland. The Gate thus offers a unique model for studying the ways in which cosmopolitan theatres, as cultural institutions, give expression to and engage with the complexities of identity and diversity in changing, globalised societies.

Broken Narrative,['Marco Mazzi'],"Broken Narrative provides an extensive reflection on history, politics, and contemporary art, revolving around the cornerstones of the artistic practice of Albanian artist Armando Lulaj. The core of the book is formed by and extended interview of Lulaj by Italian artist and writer Marco Mazzi. This inquiry starts in the year 1997, a year of social and political upheaval in Albania, of anarchy, controversies and emigration, of toxic seeds of neoliberalism sprouting in an already wounded country, and continues to the present day, where politics, hidden behind art forms, has practically destroyed (again) every different and possible future of the country. This book also sketches out a connection between the recent Albanian political context and contemporary art by considering the realities of Albania as essential for an understanding of the dynamics of international power in contemporary art and architecture, and the role of politics therein. Broken Narrative comes in a bilingual English-Japanese edition, in part as homage to the subtle esthetics of Japanese poetry, which has inspired many of the Lulaj's works, while equally evoking the subversive films of the Red Army, active in Japan at the turn of the 1960s and '70s. Broken Narrative contains a double preface in English by Albanian scholar Jonida Gashi and in Japanese by photographer Osamu Kanemura. Armando Lulaj was born in Tirana in 1980. He is a writer of plays, texts on risk territories, filmmaker, and producer of conflict images. He's research is orientated towards accentuating the border between economical power, fictional democracy, and social disparity in a global context. His main topics of interest remain power, corruption and institutional critique. Lulaj has participated in many international exhibitions and film festivals. His works are part of various important private and public collections. Armando Lulaj is one of the founders of DebatikCenter of Contemporary Art. Marco Mazzi (1980) is an Italian photographer and writer living and working between Florence, Tokyo, and Tirana. Mazzi studied Contemporary Literature at the University of Florence and has also studied Japanese avant-garde art and visual poetry in Japan. In 2008, Mazzi founded the non-profit organization Relational Cinema Association within the University of Waseda in Tokyo. Mazzi was photographer-in-residence at The Department of Eagles (Tirana, Albania) during the conference Pedagogies of Disaster and for the project Lapidari, and he was the stage and still photographer for Armando Lulaj's Recapitulation (2015), commissioned by the 2015 Venice Biennale' s Albanian Pavilion.",365.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZgSVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZgSVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA158&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=57&source=gbs_api,The Politics of Contemporary Art in Albania,No link available

The critical essays, interviews, and poetry collected here focus on people and methods that do not seek inclusion in the hierarchical order of gendered racial capitalism. Rather, they focus on aggrieved peoples who have always had to negotiate state violence and cultural erasure, but who also work to build the worlds they envision. These collectivities seek to transform social structures and establish a new social warrant guided by what W.E.B. Du Bois called 'abolition democracy, ' a way of being and thinking that privileges people, mutual interdependence, and ecological harmony over individualist self-aggrandizement and profits.

Body Politics Rethinking Gender and Masculinity,['Tanmoy Baghira & Ananya Mukherjee'],"The research on men and masculinities traces back to the women’s and gay liberation movements that challenged existing understandings of gender and power. This proposes to look into gender as socially constructed than what was earlier thought to be biological. As a logical extension of Feminism, Masculinity Studies looks into sex/gender as a discursive social construct and tries to understand them through theoretical hermeneutics. Instead of considering masculinity to be ‘natural character type’, ‘a behavioural average’ or ‘a norm’, the focus should be given to the process through which the gendered bodies perform. In this regard, sex/gender is not fixed, instead is in a continuous flux; thus, masculinity should be recognised as a gender presentation that is continuously transforming and evolving. This volume, Body Politics: Rethinking Gender and Masculinity will engage with the current developments in the field of Masculinity Studies and will try to diversify the issues of gender and masculinity.",23.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cTwqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cTwqEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=63&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Taking English Planning Law Scholarship Seriously,"['Maria Lee', 'Carolyn Abbot']","Planning is at the heart of the response to many of the significant challenges of our time, from the climate and environmental crises to social and economic inequalities. It is embedded in, as well as partially constituting, our democratic systems, so that the challenges of democratic decision-making in a complex society cannot be avoided when thinking about planning. Planning law raises some of the most fundamental questions faced by legal scholars, from the legitimacy of authority to the relationship between public and private rights and interests. And yet, planning law has been relatively neglected by legal scholars. The objective of Taking English Planning Law Scholarship Seriously is to create space for planning law scholarship in all of its variety, and for curiosity about law in all its complexity. The chapters reflect this diversity and complexity, covering a range of the objects of planning (from housing to energy to highways) and a multiplicity of planning tasks and tools (from compulsory purchase to contracting to planning inquiries).",317.0,['Law'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l9aIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l9aIEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=64&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l9aIEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-l9aIEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

How We Read,"['Kaitlin Heller', 'Suzanne Conklin Akbari']","What do we do when we read? Reading can be an act of consumption or an act of creation. Our ""work reading"" overlaps with our ""pleasure reading,"" and yet these two modes of reading engage with different parts of the self. It is sometimes passive, sometimes active, and can even be an embodied form. The contributors to this volume share their own histories of reading in order to reveal the shared pleasure that lies in this most solitary of acts - which is also, paradoxically, the act of most complete plenitude. Many of the contributors engage in academic writing, and several publish in other genres, including poetry and fiction; some contributors maintain an active online presence. All are engaged with reading's capacity to stimulate and excite as well as to frustrate and confuse. The synergies and tensions of online reading and print reading animate these thirteen contributions, generating a sense of shared community. Together, the authors open their libraries to us.

Just faith,['Stephan de Beer'],"The purpose of this scholarly book is to expand the body of knowledge available on urban theology. It introduces readers to the concept of planetary urbanisation, with the view of deepening an understanding of urbanisation and its all-pervasive impact on the planet, people and places from a theological perspective. A critical theological reading of ‘the urban’ is also provided, deliberating on bridging the divide between voices from the Global South and the Global North. In doing so, this book simultaneously seeks out robust and dynamic faith constructs, expressed in various forms and embodiments of justice. The methodology chosen transcended narrow disciplinary boundaries, situating reflections between and across disciplines, in the interface between scholarly reflection and an activist faith, as well as between local rootedness and global connectedness. This was facilitated by the collected gathering of authors, spanning all continents, various Christian faith traditions and multiple disciplines, as well as a range of methodological approaches. The book endeavours to contribute to knowledge production in a number of ways. Firstly, it suggests the inadequacy of most dominant faith expressions in the face of all-pervasive forces of urbanisation, and it also provides clues as to the possibility of fostering potent alternative imaginaries. Secondly, it explores a decolonial faith that is expressed in various forms of justice. It is an attempt to offer concrete embodiments of what such a faith could look like in the context of planetary urbanisation. Thirdly, the book does not focus on one specific urban challenge or mode of ministry but rather introduces the concept of planetary urbanisation and then offers critical lenses with which to interrogate its consequences and challenges. It considers concrete and liberating faith constructs in areas ranging from gender, race, economic inequality, a solidarity economics and housing to urban violence, indigeneity and urbanisation, the interface between economic and environmental sustainability, and grass-roots theological education.",398.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BL6PDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BL6PDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=70&source=gbs_api,Glocal Responses to Planetary Urbanization,No link available

Xinjiang Year Zero,"['Darren Byler', 'Ivan Franceschini', 'Nicholas Loubere']","Since 2017, the Chinese authorities have detained hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities in ‘reeducation camps’ in China’s northwestern Xinjiang autonomous region. While the official reason for this mass detention was to prevent terrorism, the campaign has since become a wholesale attempt to remould the ways of life of these peoples—an experiment in social engineering aimed at erasing their cultures and traditions in order to transform them into ‘civilised’ citizens as construed by the Chinese state. Through a collection of essays penned by scholars who have conducted extensive research in the region, this volume sets itself three goals: first, to document the reality of the emerging surveillance state and coercive assimilation unfolding in Xinjiang in recent years and continuing today; second, to describe the workings and analyse the causes of these policies, highlighting how these developments insert themselves not only in domestic Chinese trends, but also in broader global dynamics; and, third, to propose action, to heed the progressive Left’s call since Marx to change the world and not just analyse it. ‘Xinjiang Year Zero provides an analysis of the processes of dispossession being experienced by Uyghurs and other indigenous peoples of China’s Uyghur region that is sorely needed today. Most politicians and their followers today, whether on the left or the right, view what is happening to the peoples of this region through a twentieth-century lens steeped in dichotomies that are obsolete in describing the nature of states today—those of capitalism vs socialism and democracy vs totalitarianism. The contributors to this volume explore what is happening in Xinjiang in the context of the twenty-first century’s racialised and populist-fuelled state power, global capitalist exploitation, and ubiquitous surveillance technology. At the same time, they invite the reader to reflect on how the processes of dispossession in the Uyghur region during the twenty-first century are repeating the colonial practices of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that have shaped our current global system of inequality and oppression. The result offers an analysis of what is happening in Xinjiang that emphasises its interconnectedness to what is happening around us everywhere in the world. If you believe that the repression in this region is a fabrication to ‘manufacture consent’ for a cold war between the “West” and China, you need to read this book. Afterwards, you will understand that if you want to stop a return to the twentieth-century geopolitical conflicts embodied in the idea of a cold war, you must establish solidarity with the Indigenous peoples of China’s northwest and call for the end to the global processes fuelling their dispossession both inside China and outside.’ — Sean R. Roberts, Director of International Development Studies, The George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, and author of The War on the Uyghurs ‘Xinjiang Year Zero provides a highly readable and utterly necessary account of what is happening in Xinjiang and why. By showing how the mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Xinjiang Muslims are linked to both global capitalism and histories of settler colonialism, the edited book offers new ways of understanding the situation and thus working toward change. A must-read not only for those interested in contemporary China, but also for anyone who cares about digital surveillance and dispossession around the globe.’ — Emily T. Yeh, University of Colorado Boulder, author of Taming Tibet: Landscape Transformation and the Gift of Chinese Development ‘The crisis in Xinjiang has engendered its own crisis of interpretation and action at a time of growing geopolitical rivalry: how to condemn the atrocities without supporting hawkish voices, particularly among US politicians, who seek to Cold War-ise the US relationship with “Communist China”? How to critique China for colonialism, racism, assimilationism, extra-legal internment, and coerced labour when many Western nations are built on a history of those same things? Xinjiang Year Zero not only provides non-specialists a thorough, readable, up-to-date account of events in Xinjiang. This much-needed book also offers a broader framing of the crisis, drawing comparisons to settler colonialism elsewhere and revealing direct connections to global capitalism and to the rise of technological surveillance everywhere.’ — James A. Millward, Georgetown University, author of Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang",338.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FahaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FahaEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=74&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Marriage Discourses,"['Jowan A. Mohammed', 'Frank Jacob']","Marriage was historically not only a romantic ideal, but a tool of exploitation of women in many regards. Women were often considered commodities and marriage was far away from the romantic stereotypes people relate to it today. While marriages served as diplomatic tools or means of political legitimization in the past, the discourses about marital relationships changed and women expressed their demands more openly. Discourses about marriage in history and literature naturally became more and more heated, especially during the ""long"" 19th century, when marriages were contested by social reformers or political radicals, male and female alike. The present volume provides a discussion of the role of marriage and the discourses about in different chronological and geographical contexts and shows which arguments played an important role for the demand for more equality in martial relationships. It focuses on marriage discourses, may they have been legal or rather socio-political ones. In addition, the disputes about marriage in literary works of the 19th and 20th centuries are presented to complement the historical debates.",265.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EHFOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EHFOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=76&source=gbs_api,Historical and Literary Perspectives on Gender Inequality and Patriarchic Exploitation,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EHFOEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-EHFOEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Self-Actualization in the Age of Crisis,['Ron Rivers'],"""A well-thought-out manual, promoting individual and shared responsibility against a backdrop of space, time, and connectivity, and the idiosyncrasies of these constructs."" - Book Viral Reviews New frameworks of meaning and value informed by our most advanced knowledge and theory. Cosmology and physics have revealed the single truth.

Democracy in a Pandemic,"['Graham Smith', 'Tim Hughes', 'Lizzie Adams', 'Charlotte Obijiaku']","Covid-19 has highlighted limitations in our democratic politics – but also lessons for how to deepen our democracy and more effectively respond to future crises. In the face of an emergency, the working assumption all too often is that only a centralised, top-down response is possible. This book exposes the weakness of this assumption, making the case for deeper participation and deliberation in times of crises. During the pandemic, mutual aid and self-help groups have realised unmet needs. And forward-thinking organisations have shown that listening to and working with diverse social groups leads to more inclusive outcomes. Participation and deliberation are not just possible in an emergency. They are valuable, perhaps even indispensable. This book draws together a diverse range of voices of activists, practitioners, policy makers, researchers and writers. Together they make visible the critical role played by participation and deliberation during the pandemic and make the case for enhanced engagement during and beyond emergency contexts. Another, more democratic world can be realised in the face of a crisis.

What Should Schools Teach?,"['Alka Sehgal Cuthbert ', 'Alex Standis']","The design of school curriculums involves deep thought about the nature of knowledge and its value to learners and society. It is a serious responsibility that raises a number of questions. What is knowledge for? What knowledge is important for children to learn? How do we decide what knowledge matters in each school subject? And how far should the knowledge we teach in school be related to academic disciplinary knowledge? These and many other questions are taken up in What Should Schools Teach? The blurring of distinctions between pedagogy and curriculum, and between experience and knowledge, has served up a confusing message for teachers about the part that each plays in the education of children. Schools teach through subjects, but there is little consensus about what constitutes a subject and what they are for. This book aims to dispel confusion through a robust rationale for what schools should teach that offers key understanding to teachers of the relationship between knowledge (what to teach) and their own pedagogy (how to teach), and how both need to be informed by values of intellectual freedom and autonomy. This second edition includes new chapters on Chemistry, Drama, Music and Religious Education, and an updated chapter on Biology. A revised introduction reflects on emerging discourse around decolonizing the curriculum, and on the relationship between the knowledge that children encounter at school and in their homes.",284.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xJ8eEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xJ8eEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=81&source=gbs_api,"Disciplines, subjects and the pursuit of truth",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xJ8eEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xJ8eEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Lockdown Cultures,"[' Stella Bruzzi', 'Maurice Biriotti']","Lockdown Cultures is both a cultural response to our extraordinary times and a manifesto for the arts and humanities and their role in our post-pandemic society. This book offers a unique response to the question of how the humanities commented on and were impacted by one of the dominant crises of our times: the Covid-19 pandemic. While the role of engineers, epidemiologists and, of course, medics is assumed, Lockdown Cultures illustrates some of the ways in which the humanities understood and analysed 2020–21, the year of lockdown and plague. Though the impulse behind the book was topical, underpinning the richly varied and individual essays is a lasting concern with the value of the humanities in the twenty-first century. Each contributor approaches this differently but there are two dominant strands: how art and culture can help us understand the Covid crisis; and how the value of the humanities can be demonstrated by engaging with cultural products from the past. The result is a book that serves as testament to the humanities’ reinvigorated and reforged sense of identity, from the perspective of UCL and one of the leading arts and humanities faculties in the world. It bears witness to a globally impactful event while showcasing interdisciplinary thinking and examining how the pandemic has changed how we read, watch, write and educate.

A House on Water,"[' Kameel Ahmady', 'کامیل احمدی']","There are contradictory attitudes toward temporary marriage in Iranian society. The proponents consider it as a means to prevent social degradation and moral corruption while the opponents take it as a pleasure-seeking tool for men in violation of the rights of children and women. This study supports the view that temporary marriage is a back door to sexual exploitation. According to the study’s findings, mut'ah is a practice that lacks redeeming values and positive functions. Rather, it causes harms such as child marriage, the collapse of the family foundation, negative attitudes towards permanent marriage, the promotion of corruption and violations of women’s rights. Many women agree to be subjected to sexual exploitation because they lack economic rights and a sense of security. As an institution, it is not without controversy. In fact, child marriage is partly the result of the tradition of sigheh mahramiat which paves the road for increase of child marriage in Iran. It is performed in some Iranian families when their sons and daughters are in early puberty, or even before then, to supervise the sexual behaviour of children, to prevent them from committing a sin, for fear of girls’ solitude at older ages, to fight against social and cultural pressures related to communication between young girls and boys (which are more obvious in small communities), and to facilitate smoother relations between two families. The religious and traditional stratum of the Iranian society performs sigheh / sigheh mahramiat and continues to follow this tradition. Both the country’s laws and the jurisprudence treat the permanent and temporary marriages the same although they are different in nature and so far temporary marriage has not been addressed as an independent subject. The religious and legal ambiguities surrounding sigheh and temporary marriage and inattention to Iran’s social circumstances lead to grave consequences such as child marriage, school drop-out, violation of women’s rights and in particular physical and emotional vulnerabilities of women and girls. Revision of laws pertaining to sigheh/temporary marriage while considering the social characteristics of the society can serve as a key solution to minimize these negative impacts",,['Computers'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ubpvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ubpvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA164&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=96&source=gbs_api,A Comprehensive Study on Sigheh Mahramiat and Temporary Marriage in Iran,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ubpvEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ubpvEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Suture,['KJ Cerankowski'],"""Combining memoir, lyrical essay, and cultural criticism, KJ Cerankowski's Suture: Trauma and Trans Becoming stitches together an embodied history of trauma and its ongoing impacts on the lived realities of trans, queer, and other marginalized subjects. Suture is a conjuration, a patchwork knitting of ghost stories attending to the wound as its own archive. It is a journey through many ""transitions"": of gender; through illness and chronic pain; from childhood to adulthood and back again; of psyche and form in the wake of abuse and through the work of healing; and of the self, becoming in and through the ongoingness of settler colonial violence and its attendant subjugations of diverse forms of life. Refusing a traditional binary-based gender transition narrative, as well as dominant psychoanalytic narratives of trauma that center an individual process of symptom, diagnosis, and cure, Suture explores the refractive nature of trauma's dispersed roots and lingering effects. If the wounds of trauma are disquiet apparitions--repetitions within the cut--these stories tend the seams through which the simultaneous loneliness of mourning and togetherness of queer intersubjective relations converge. Across these essays, healing, and indeed living, is a state of perpetual becoming, surviving, and loving, in the nonlinearities of trauma time, body-time, and queer time.""--",251.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oAWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oAWVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=98&source=gbs_api,Trauma and Trans Becoming,No link available

Queer Insists,"[""Michael O'Rourke""]","Queer Insists is a memorial essay, a work of mourning, written for the queer theorist and performance scholar José Esteban Muñoz (1967-2013) shortly after his untimely death in December 2013. In a series of fragments, not unlike Roland Barthes's Mourning Diary, Michael O'Rourke shares memories of Muñoz, the stories and reflections of his friends in the wake of his passing, and readings of his work from Disidentifications to Cruising Utopia and beyond. O'Rourke argues that, for Muñoz, queer does not exist, per se, but rather insists, soliciting us from the future to-come. Muñoz reached towards teleopoietic worlds as he invented a queer theory we have yet to find, but are invited to glimpse.Among the Muñozian themes this chapbook discusses are hope, utopia, affect, punk rock, heresy, the undercommons, temporality, hauntology, forgetting, loss, ephemera, partage, sense, incommensurability, the event and democracy.In reading Muñoz as a Rogue Theorist, this book borrows many of the gifts we have received (and have yet to receive) from him, marking the force and luminescence of his thought, and insisting upon the rare and precious singularity of his work. Muñoz bequeaths to us a queer studies without condition which it is our duty to foster and to bear as we carry it and him into the unknowable futures of an indiscipline.",77.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AgSVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AgSVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=LGBTQ%2B&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=102&source=gbs_api,(for José Esteban Muñoz),No link available

It is free to read at Oxford Clinical Psychology Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. The theory of mentalizing and epistemic trust introduced by Peter Fonagy and colleagues at the Anna Freud Centre has been an important perspective on mental health and illness. Mentalizing and Epistemic Trust is the first comprehensive account and evaluation of this perspective. The book explores twenty primary concepts that organize the contributions of Fonagy and colleagues: adaptation, aggression, the alien self, culture, disorganized attachment, epistemic trust, hypermentalizing, reflective function, the P factor, pretend mode, the primary unconscious, psychic equivalence, mental illness, mentalizing, mentalization-based therapy, non-mentalizing, the self, sexuality, the social environment, and teleological mode. The biographical and social context of the development of these ideas is examined. The book also specifies the current strengths and limitations of the theory of mentalizing and epistemic trust, with attention to the implications for both clinicians and researchers.

Structuring the Void,['Jerome Klinkowitz'],"If, as the literary theorists of postmodernism contend, ""content"" does not exist, then how can fiction continue to be written? Jerome Klinkowitz, himself a veteran practitioner and theorist of fiction, addresses this question in Structuring the Void, an account of what today's novelists and short story writers do when they produce a fictive work. Klinkowitz focuses on the ways in which writers, finding themselves in the same position as abstract painters and death-of-God theologians, have turned their inquiry itself into subject matter, and he shows how this approach has in recent years produced something more than mere metafictive self-questioning. With no subject to structure, the writers Klinkowitz discusses nonetheless persist in the act of structuring. For Kurt Vonnegut, this has meant finding a form for an otherwise unrepresentable world by organizing his autobiography as a narrative device. In the generation following Vonnegut, Max Apple makes a similar move in the ritualization of a national history and popular culture, while Gerald Rosen and Rob Swigart invent a style of literary comedy based on their comic response to a new imaginative state, the state of California. Klinkowitz also considers subjects that, though they cannot be represented, nevertheless exercise constraints on a writer's intention to structure. In recent decades, two of these pressing themes have been gender (as seen here in the works of Grace Paley) and war (the Vietnam conflict itself as well as the struggles of two generations to come to terms with it). Structuring the void left when content collapses, these writers have, as Klinkowitz demonstrates, developed an entirely new style of fiction, one that necessarily privileges space over time and self-invention over representation.",200.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nL1ZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nL1ZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=4&source=gbs_api,The Struggle for Subject in Contemporary American Fiction,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nL1ZAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-nL1ZAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Life, Re-Scaled","['Liliane Campos', 'Pierre-Louis Patoine']","This edited volume explores new engagements with the life sciences in contemporary fiction, poetry, comics and performance. The gathered case studies investigate how recent creative work reframes the human within microscopic or macroscopic scales, from cellular biology to systems ecology, and engages with the ethical, philosophical, and political issues raised by the twenty-first century’s shifting views of life. The collection thus examines literature and performance as spaces that shape our contemporary biological imagination. Comprised of thirteen chapters by an international group of academics, Life, Re-Scaled: The Biological Imagination in Twenty-First-Century Literature and Performance engages with four main areas of biological study: ‘Invisible scales: cells, microbes and mycelium’, ‘Neuro-medical imaging and diagnosis’, ‘Pandemic imaginaries’, and ‘Ecological scales’. The authors examine these concepts in emerging forms such as plant theatre, climate change art, ecofiction and pandemic fiction, including the work of Jeff Vandermeer, Jon McGregor, Jeff Lemire, and Extinction Rebellion’s Red Rebel Brigade performances. This valuable resource moves beyond the biological paradigms that were central to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to outline the specificity of a contemporary imagination. Life, Re-Scaled is crucial reading for academics, scholars, and authors alike, as it proposes an unprecedented overview of the relationship between literature, performance and the life sciences in the twenty-first century.",262.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XXqUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XXqUEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=11&source=gbs_api,The Biological Imagination in Twenty-First-Century Literature and Performance,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XXqUEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-XXqUEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Enemy in Contemporary Film,"['Martin Löschnigg', 'Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż']","Culture and conflict inevitably go hand in hand. The very idea of culture is marked by the notion of difference and by the creative, fraught interaction between conflicting concepts and values. The same can be said of all key ideas in the study of culture, such as identity and diversity, memory and trauma, the translation of cultures and globalization, dislocation and emplacement, mediation and exclusion. This series publishes theoretically informed original scholarship from the fields of literary and cultural studies as well as media, visual, and film studies. It fosters an interdisciplinary dialogue on the multiple ways in which conflict supports and constrains the production of meaning, on how conflict is represented, how it relates to the past and projects the present, and how it frames scholarship within the humanities.

Prose Fiction: An Introduction to the Semiotics of Narrative,['Ignasi Ribó'],"This concise and highly accessible textbook outlines the principles and techniques of storytelling. It is intended as a high-school and college-level introduction to the central concepts of narrative theory – concepts that will aid students in developing their competence not only in analysing and interpreting short stories and novels, but also in writing them. This textbook prioritises clarity over intricacy of theory, equipping its readers with the necessary tools to embark on further study of literature, literary theory and creative writing. Building on a ‘semiotic model of narrative,’ it is structured around the key elements of narratological theory, with chapters on plot, setting, characterisation, and narration, as well as on language and theme – elements which are underrepresented in existing textbooks on narrative theory. The chapter on language constitutes essential reading for those students unfamiliar with rhetoric, while the chapter on theme draws together significant perspectives from contemporary critical theory (including feminism and postcolonialism). This textbook is engaging and easily navigable, with key concepts highlighted and clearly explained, both in the text and in a full glossary located at the end of the book. Throughout the textbook the reader is aided by diagrams, images, quotes from prominent theorists, and instructive examples from classical and popular short stories and novels (such as Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Franz Kafka’s ‘The Metamorphosis,’ J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, or Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov, amongst many others). Prose Fiction: An Introduction to the Semiotics of Narrative can either be incorporated as the main textbook into a wider syllabus on narrative theory and creative writing, or it can be used as a supplementary reference book for readers interested in narrative fiction. The textbook is a must-read for beginning students of narratology, especially those with no or limited prior experience in this area. It is of especial relevance to English and Humanities major students in Asia, for whom it was conceived and written.",262.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TGDIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TGDIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=31&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TGDIDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TGDIDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

But when Kavya too joins him after her man was poisoned there ensues the tussle of a love triangle, which gets unraveled in a poignant end, but not before a series of murders. So, then who could have poisoned Ranjit the realtor, Shakeel the Inspector, Pravar the criminal and Natya his accomplice?

As life brings Chandra, who suffers from an inferiority complex for his perceived ugliness, and Nithya, who was bogged down being jilted by Vasu, together, they script their fate of fulfillment. And as poetic justice would have it, Sathya, who caused Prema's heart burn, himself was led down the garden path by Kala, doing a Sathya on Sathya.

Hadrian and the Christians,['Marco Rizzi'],"The Second Century occupies a central place in the development of ancient Christianity. The aim of the book is to examine how in the cultural, social, and religious efflorescence of the Second Century,to be witnessed inphenomena such as the Second Sophistic, Christianity found a peculiar way of integrating into the more general transformation of the Empire and how this allowed the emerging religion to establish and flourish in Graeco-Roman society. Hadrian’s reign was the starting point ofthat process and opened new possibilities of self-definition and external self-presentation to Christianity, as well asto other social and religious agencies. Differently from Judaism, however, Christianity fully seized the opportunity,thus gaining an increasing place in Graeco-Roman society, which ultimately led to the first Christian peace under the Severan emperors. The point at issue is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective (including archaeology, cultural, religious, and political history) to challenge well-established, but no longer satisfactory, historical and hermeneutical paradigms. The contributors aim to examine institutional issues and sociocultural processes in their different aspects, as they were made possibleon Hadrian’s initiative andresulted inthemerge of early Christianityinto the Roman Empire.",192.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BdQtshCmxZwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BdQtshCmxZwC&pg=PA132&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=173&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BdQtshCmxZwC&rdid=book-BdQtshCmxZwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Mediating Vulnerability,"['Anneleen Masschelein ', 'Florian Mussgnug', 'Jennifer Rushworth']","Mediating Vulnerability examines vulnerability from a range of connected perspectives. It responds to the vulnerability of species, their extinction but also their transformation. This tension between extreme danger and creativity is played out in literary studies through the pressures the discipline brings to bear on its own categories, particularly those of genre. Extinction and preservation on the one hand, transformation, adaptation and (re)mediation on the other. These two poles inform our comparative and interdisciplinary project. The volume is situated within the particular intercultural and intermedial context of contemporary cultural representation. Vulnerability is explored as a site of potential destruction, human as well as animal, but also as a site of potential openness. This is the first book to bring vulnerability studies into dialogue with media and genre studies. It is organised in four sections: ‘Human/Animal’; Violence/Resistance’; ‘Image/Narrative’; and ‘Medium/Genre’. Each chapter considers the intersection of vulnerability and genre from a comparative perspective, bringing together a team of international contributors and editors. The book is in dialogue with the reflections of Judith Butler and others on vulnerability, and it questions categories of genre through an interdisciplinary engagement with different representational forms, including digital culture, graphic novels, video games, photography and TV series, in addition to novels and short stories. It offers new readings of high-profile contemporary authors of fiction including Margaret Atwood and Cormac McCarthy, as well as bringing lesser-known figures to the fore.",272.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1sdQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1sdQEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=185&source=gbs_api,Comparative approaches and questions of genre,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1sdQEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1sdQEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Vanity Fair,['William Makepeace Thackeray'],"Vanity Fair is perhaps Thackeray’s most famous novel. First serialized over the course of 19 volumes in Punch Magazine and first printed as a single volume in 1849, the novel cemented Thackeray’s literary fame and kept him busy with frequent revisions and even lecture circuits. The story is framed as a puppet play, narrated by an unreliable narrator, that presents the story of Becky Sharp and Emmy Sedley and the people in their lives as they struggle through the Napoleonic Wars. The story itself, like many other Thackeray novels, is a satire of the lives of the Victorian English of a certain class. Thackeray packed the novel with allusions, many of which were difficult even for his contemporary readers; part of the heavy revisions he later made were making the allusions more accessible to his evolving audience. As part of his satirical bent, Thackeray made a point to make each character flawed, so that there are no “heroes” in the book—hence the subtitle “A Novel Without a Hero.” Thackeray’s goal was not only to entertain, but to instruct; to that end, he wanted the reader to look within themselves after finishing the unhappy conclusion, in which there’s no hint as to how society might be able to improve on the evils shadowed in the events of the novel. Vanity Fair received glowing praise by its critical contemporaries, and remains a popular book well into modern times, having been adapted repeatedly for film, radio, and television. This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.",976.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2hoZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2hoZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=224&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2hoZEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2hoZEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Mansfield Park,['Jane Austen'],"At the age of 10, Fanny Price, the daughter of a poor Portsmouth family, is sent to live with her wealthy uncle’s family, the Bertrams, at the country estate of Mansfield Park. The Bertrams treat her cruelly at first, and Fanny has trouble fitting in. Her female cousins, Maria and Julia, are fashionable and vapid, and her elder male cousin, Tom, is a drunk. The only family member she feels a connection to is the younger Edmund, who is preparing for life in the clergy. When her uncle leaves to manage business in Antigua, Henry and Mary Crawford, siblings from the region, come to live at Mansfield Park as well. Their arrival begins a series of romantic engagements that strains the entire family’s relationships. Mansfield Park is unusual in that despite it being a great public success, with the first edition selling out in six months and a second edition selling out two years later, it wasn’t publicly reviewed until 1821, seven years after it was first published. Contemporary reviews were generally good, praising the novel’s morality. Modern reviews are more mixed, making it one of Austen’s more controversial works. Modern critics have called it everything from eccentric and difficult to thoughtful and profound, with any number of interpretations possible depending on the lens one views the work through. This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.",515.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yFsXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yFsXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=241&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yFsXEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yFsXEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
A Contemporary Archaeology of London’s Mega Events,['Jonathan Gardner'],"A Contemporary Archaeology of London’s Mega Events explores the traces of London’s most significant modern ‘mega events’. Though only open for a few weeks or months, mega events permanently and disruptively reshape their host cities and societies: they demolish and rebuild whole districts, they draw in materials and participants from around the globe and their organisers self-consciously seek to leave a ‘legacy’ that will endure for decades or more. With London as his case study, Jonathan Gardner argues that these spectacles must be seen as long-lived and persistent, rather than simply a transient or short-term phenomena. Using a novel methodology drawn from the subfield of contemporary archaeology – the archaeology of the recent past and present-day – a broad range of comparative studies are used to explore the long-term history of each event. These include the contents and building materials of the Great Exhibition’s Crystal Palace and their extraordinary ‘afterlife’ at Sydenham, South London; how the Festival of Britain’s South Bank Exhibition employed displays of ancient history to construct a new post-war British identity; and how London 2012, as the latest of London’s mega events, dealt with competing visions of the past as archaeology, waste and ‘heritage’ in creating a vision of the future.",304.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g5ZsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g5ZsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=246&source=gbs_api,From the Great Exhibition to London 2012,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g5ZsEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-g5ZsEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Scarlet Letter,['Nathaniel Hawthorne'],"The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850; it was one of the first books to be mass-produced in America, which helped ensure its immediate popularity and ubiquitous presence on contemporary shelves. Its first printing of 2,500 books sold out in ten days. The novel is set in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony between the years 1642 and 1649. Hester Prynne has had a child out of wedlock, and its father is a mystery. For her sin, she is made to wear an embroidered scarlet A on her clothes—for “Adulteress.” She now faces a life of unending shame in the stern and religious Puritan colony, in a part of the world where there are no others to turn to. While the plot is simple, the novel is highly allegorical. It explores themes of sin, guilt, repentance, forgiveness, alienation, and legalism. Characters have symbolic names and appearances, and many aspects of the narrative can be viewed in a symbolist lens. Hawthorne initially thought the novel was too short for publication on its own; to pad the length, he included the “Customhouse” introduction. The introduction angered the residents of Salem, who thought the introduction was poking mean-spirited fun at them. This prompted Hawthorne to republish the book “without the change of a word,” but with a reassurance that the introduction was meant in good spirits. The novel has been consistently popular since its publication, with it being required reading in many American high schools. D. H. Lawrence called it “a perfect work of American imagination.” This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.",277.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cBsZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cBsZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=248&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cBsZEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-cBsZEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Critique of Sovereignty,['Marc Lombardo'],"Using the Western tradition of metaphysical and political thought as a backdrop, Critique of Sovereignty (a work in 4 volumes) re-examines the concept of sovereignty in order to better understand why our ethical values and technical capacities often seem so divorced from our lived realities. On the one hand, ostensibly self-enclosed entities like the nation-state and the person are rhetorically bolstered as sites of technical agency and/or moral responsibility. On the other hand, these same entities appear fragile - if not purely fictional - in relation to ever ongoing tidal processes such as the migration, diffusion, and conglomeration of bodies, capital, ideas, etc. While some of our institutions might work some of the time, they always seem to work differently than we like to think they do. Accordingly, the forging of more humane institutions might very well entail if not require ways of thinking that strive to undo the self-imagined binds, exceptions, and sureties of thought for the sake of embracing a continuity with all that withers, decays, and falls away. Book I, ""Contemporary Theories of Sovereignty,"" compares the varied interpretations of sovereignty given by a range of 20th-century political theorists (Maritain, Foucault, Derrida, Schmitt, Agamben, Hardt, and Negri) with Jean Bodin's initial outline of the concept, rendered at the outset of modern political thought in the 16th century. The analytic framework of sovereignty encountered in these comparative readings provides an initial point of departure for unfolding a method of critique appropriate to the concept of sovereignty. Sovereignty is an ideal starting point for a critique of the deadlocks between thought and reality for a simple reason: it doesn't actually exist. When it serves as a guide to action, sovereignty may be regarded as a particularly captivating fantasy. The closer it appears, the further it recedes, and, too often, the more vigorously it is pursued. Other books to appear later in this series include Book II: The Concept of Sovereignty in the History of Philosophy, Book III: Aristotle's Politics, and Book IV: Consequences of Sovereignty.",115.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cAWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cAWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=250&source=gbs_api,Book I: Contemporary Theories of Sovereignty,No link available
Terrorizing Images,"['Charles Ivan Armstrong', 'Unni Langas']","Culture and conflict inevitably go hand in hand. The very idea of culture is marked by the notion of difference and by the creative, fraught interaction between conflicting concepts and values. The same can be said of all key ideas in the study of culture, such as identity and diversity, memory and trauma, the translation of cultures and globalization, dislocation and emplacement, mediation and exclusion. This series publishes theoretically informed original scholarship from the fields of literary and cultural studies as well as media, visual, and film studies. It fosters an interdisciplinary dialogue on the multiple ways in which conflict supports and constrains the production of meaning, on how conflict is represented, how it relates to the past and projects the present, and how it frames scholarship within the humanities.

Ron is still Annie's white knight, even if h's decidedly more tarnished in Dana Sue's eyes. But he still looks good enough to eat, and maybe, just maybe, to forgive.

The Urban Condition,"['Ghent Urban Studies Team', 'Dirk De Meyer']","What does the Western city at the end of the twentieth century look like? How did the modern metropolis of congestion and density turn into a posturban or even postsuburban cityscape? What are edge cities and technoburbs? How has the social composition of cities changed in the postwar era? What do gated communities tell us about social fragmentation? Is public space in the contemporary city being privatized and militarized? How can the urban self still be defined? What role does consumer aestheticism have to play in this? These and many more questions are addressed by this uniquely conceived multidisciplinary study. The Urban Condition seeks to interfere in current debates over the future and interpretation of our urban landscapes by reuniting studies of the city as a physical and material phenomenon and as a cultural and mental (arte)fact.

It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Imagination will remain a mystery--we will not be able to explain imagination--until we can break it into parts we already understand. Explaining Imagination is a guidebook for doing just that, where the parts are other ordinary mental states like beliefs, desires, judgments, and decisions. In different combinations and contexts, these states constitute cases of imagining. This reductive approach to imagination is at direct odds with the current orthodoxy, according to which imagination is a sui generis mental state or process--one with its own inscrutable principles of operation. Explaining Imagination upends that view, showing how, on closer inspection, the imaginings at work in hypothetical reasoning, pretense, the enjoyment of fiction, and creativity are reducible to other familiar mental states--judgments, beliefs, desires, and decisions among them.

Moshkel Gosha,['Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee'],"Through this ancient Persian story of a prickly-bush digger and his daughter who discover magical stones that bring wealth and disaster, this tale explores the different ways to nourish and care for the soul. As an invitation to the dimensions of love, power, and divine sustenance, Moshkel Gosha's magical story shows how to value and protect a deep longing for inner truth in the contemporary age. The accompanying commentary highlights the story and applies its principles to the spiritual needs and challenges of the contemporary world. “This little book is a priceless jewel. It is such a joy to read age-old truths set in the context of another language and other customs, and to have the essence of these truths translated so beautifully and powerfully into a language we can all understand.” —Robert Johnson, author He, She, Inner Work, and Balancing Heaven & Earth “Moshkel Gosha is a mysterious Sufi story with different levels of meaning. This commentary gives many valuable insights into the hidden significance of this story. It shows how an ancient Sufi teaching story contains the answer to one of today's most important psychological and spiritual questions: how to let the healing and transformative power of the inner world become a part of our everyday life.” —Irina Tweedie, author, Daughter of Fire: A Diary of a Spiritual Training with a Sufi Master “Those seeking a rich inner life will find this little book deeply rewarding.

1967,['David Stuart Ryan'],"Announcing the publication of what will come to be seen as the definitive portrayal of the amazing year that was 1967, ‘the summer of love’ 1967 ISBN-13:978-1492226918 Available as an ebook and printed book '1967' plots the course of a momentous year. The year when pop turned into progressive rock and masterpieces from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones provided the soundtrack to what were revolutionary times. The novel by David Stuart Ryan, author of the bestselling 'John Lennon's Secret’, describes the events as they happen month by month, through the non-stop kaleidoscope of the life of Paul Dane, an advertising copywriter, and his circle of friends. If you thought the world of ‘Mad Men’ was strange, the adventures in this volume will only confirm all your wildest suspicions. You live out the exhilarating, unpredictable but always totally engaging events, music and experimentation that stamped themselves on a year, and produced the legendary 'summer of love'. There has probably never been a time when the women were so willing, the mood music so congenial, the artificial aids to expanded consciousness so freely available. You start to realize as you progress through the heady months of 1967 that everything is evolving at a fantastic speed, a whole year's evolution appears to take place in a month, or less, as the young suddenly and inexplicably begin to seek out their dreams and fantasies, aided and abetted by some of the best music every produced, the tracks that have become an intimate part of our lives and which continue to haunt and fascinate in equal measure. '1967' takes you behind the scenes to give you an understanding of just what it was like to experience this tsunami of change, of hope and ultimately of changes with profound revolutionary implications that are even today working themselves out as the old ways are rejected, as a counter-revolution runs out of steam and the visions that beguiled a whole generation move into the mainstream. And yes there is a lot of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. This is 1967. It is more 50 shades of psychedelic color than the grey of a postwar world. What a trip you are about to embark upon!

Inane Interpolations In Bhagvad-Gita,['BS Murthy'],"﻿The Manusmriti, the social doctrine of yore, and the Bhagvad-Gita, the spiritual tome in vogue that lay down the discriminatory dharma (duties) of the four social classes (castes) have been the bugbears of the Hindu backward classes. However, to their chagrin, of late, as the latter is being mindlessly promoted even though the former was constitutionally debunked, they began advocating that it too should be dumped in a dustbin. Ironically, the improbability of their progenitor Krishna, the architect of the Gita, relegating his own ilk to the social margins failed to dawn upon these that Gita supposedly slights, even to this day! Thus, their intellectuals, instead of seeking to reclaim their priceless heritage, albeit after ridding its interpolative garbage, tend to rubbish it a la throwing the baby with the bathwater, and needless to say they must ponder. Also, it is high time that the Gita-class stop laying store by the self-aggrandizing verses in this Vyāsa’s classic, evidently inserted by their progenitors that came to bedevil the Hindu spiritual integrity and social harmony. Likewise, the grumblers of the dalit desertions must see the need for setting the Hindu house in order to prevent the fractious poaching by the Church, if not to facilitate the ‘hoped for’ return of the prodigals. So also those who take pride that Hinduism is the only religion that reckons all faith as true, should be concerned about the ‘in vogue’ Gita that belittles some of their caste fellows. Besides, this work beckons the feminists to reckon the second of the two interpolations from it cited in the cover image that degrades them in unspeakable terms. It is hoped that this ‘overdue’ work, might lead the ‘denied’ castes as well as the favoured folks for an objective approach to the Gita ‘as it is’ which could dispel the misgivings of the former and the delusions of the latter, thereby bridging the Hindu emotional gulf with its abridged book that restores its original form. So, this is a must read for every Hindu, whether or not one concurs with its propositions, and likewise for the students of logic and reasoning.",51.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L-s-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L-s-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=335&source=gbs_api,(An Invocation for their Revocation),No link available

Bhagvad-Gita,['BS Murthy'],"Bhagavad-Gita is the most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue’ – so opined William von Humboldt. Though it is a matter of consensus that Bhagvad-Gita in the present length of seven hundred verses has many an interpolation to it, but no meaningful attempt has ever been made to delve into the nature and extent, not to speak of the effect of these on the Hindu society at large. The moot point that has missed the attention of all, all along, is that if the Sudras were to be so lowly in the Lord’s creation, how come then the Gita’s architect Krishna, His avatar, and Vyāsa, its chronicler, happen to be from the same lowly Hindu caste fold. Moreover, is it not absurd to suggest that either or both of them had deprecated the station of their own varna (caste) on their own in their very own Gita? The methodical codification of interpolations carried out here, for the first time ever, puts the true character of Gita in proper perspective. Identified here are hundred and ten slokas of deviant nature and or of partisan character, the source of so much misunderstanding about this book extraordinary, in certain sections of the Hindu fold. Thus, in the long run, exposing and expunging these mischievous insertions is bound to bring in new readers from these quarters to this over two millennia old classic besides altering the misconceptions of the existing adherents. In this modern rendition, the beauty of the Sanskrit slokas is reflected in the rhythmic flow of the English verses of poetic proportions even as the attendant philosophy of the song that is the Gita is captured in contemporary idiom for easy comprehension.",72.0,['Antiques & Collectibles'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zRrWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zRrWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=345&source=gbs_api,Treatise of Self-help,No link available

Sundara Kãnda,['BS Murthy'],"While Mahabharata's Bhagvad-Gita is taken as a philosophical guide, Ramayana's Sundara Kãnda is sought for spiritual solace; many believe that reading it or hearing it recited would remove all hurdles and usher in good tidings! Miracles apart, it's in the nature of this great epic to inculcate fortitude and generate hope in man for it’s a depiction of how Hanuman goes about his errand against all odds. Besides, it portrays how Seetha, on the verge of self-immolation, overcomes despair to see life in a new light? With rhythm of its verse and the flow of the narrative this sloka to sloka transcreation of the canto beautiful of Valmiki's adi kavya - the foremost poetical composition in the world, Hanuman's Odyssey that paves the way for Rama to rescue his kidnapped wife is bound to charm the readers and listeners alike. Interestingly, as the following verse illustrates, it was the forerunner of the magic realism of our times – “Gripped she then him by shadow / Cast which Hanuman coast to coast, Recalled he in dismay then / What Sugreev said at outset / That one fiend had aptitude / To grip its prey by mere shadow.” On a personal note, my paternal grandfather, Bulusu Thimmaiah-garu, like many in his time, was a life-long practitioner of Sundara Kãnda parayana (the epic’s daily recital in part or full), whose spirituality could have providentially guided me in this, rather an effortless, trans-creative endeavour.",185.0,['Antiques & Collectibles'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wBzWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wBzWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=350&source=gbs_api,Hanuman’s Odyssey,No link available
Kafka and the Universal,"['Arthur Cools', 'Vivian Liska']",Kafka’s work has been attributed a universal significance and is often regarded as the ultimate witness of the human condition in the twentieth century. Yet his work is also considered paradigmatic for the expression of the singular that cannot be subsumed under any generalization. This paradox engenders questions not only concerning the meaning of the universal as it manifests itself in (and is transformed by) Kafka’s writings but also about the expression of the singular in literary fiction as it challenges the opposition between the universal and the singular. The contributions in this volume approach these questions from a variety of perspectives. They are structured according to the following issues: ambiguity as a tool of deconstructing the pre-established philosophical meanings of the universal; the concept of the law as a major symbol for the universal meaning of Kafka’s writings; the presence of animals in Kafka’s texts; the modernist mode of writing as challenge of philosophical concepts of the universal; and the meaning and relevance of the universal in contemporary Kafka reception. This volume examines central aspects of the interplay between philosophy and literature.,333.0,['Foreign Language Study'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zurCDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zurCDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=353&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zurCDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-zurCDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Finally, it reflects on the specific, contemporary vulnerabilities of industry professionals, including the impact of new technologies, specific forms of precarity, and a particular strain of cynicism central to the industry.

Intergenerational Trauma and Healing,"['Melissa Leal', 'Beth Rose Middleton', 'Melissa Moreno']","This Special Issue of Genealogy explores the topic of “Intergenerational Trauma and Healing”. Authors examine the ways in which traumas (individual or group, and affecting humans and non-humans) that occurred in past generations reverberate into the present and how individuals, communities, and nations respond to and address those traumas. Authors also explore contemporary traumas, how they reflect ancestral traumas, and how they are being addressed through drawing on both contemporary and ancestral healing approaches. The articles define trauma broadly, including removal from homelands, ecocide, genocide, sexual or gendered violence, institutionalized and direct racism, incarceration, and exploitation, and across a wide range of spatial (home to nation) and temporal (intergenerational/ancestral and contemporary) scales. Articles also approach healing in an expansive mode, including specific individual healing practices, community-based initiatives, class-action lawsuits, group-wide reparations, health interventions, cultural approaches, and transformative legal or policy decisions. Contributing scholars for this issue are from across disciplines (including ethnic studies, genetics, political science, law, environmental policy, public health, humanities, etc.).

The End and the Beginning,['Hermynia Zur Mühlen'],"First published in Germany in 1929, The End and the Beginning is a lively personal memoir of a vanished world and of a rebellious, high-spirited young woman's struggle to achieve independence. Born in 1883 into a distinguished and wealthy aristocratic family of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hermynia Zur Muhlen spent much of her childhood travelling in Europe and North Africa with her diplomat father. After five years on her German husband's estate in czarist Russia she broke with both her family and her husband and set out on a precarious career as a professional writer committed to socialism. Besides translating many leading contemporary authors, notably Upton Sinclair, into German, she herself published an impressive number of politically engaged novels, detective stories, short stories, and children's fairy tales. Because of her outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she had to flee her native Austria in 1938 and seek refuge in England, where she died, virtually penniless, in 1951. This revised and corrected translation of Zur Muhlen's memoir - with extensive notes and an essay on the author by Lionel Gossman - will appeal especially to readers interested in women's history, the Central European aristocratic world that came to an end with the First World War, and the culture and politics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",300.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gd1Aw0ZlEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_gd1Aw0ZlEwC&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=384&source=gbs_api,The Book of My Life,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gd1Aw0ZlEwC&rdid=book-_gd1Aw0ZlEwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Grammar and poetry have been laid out. Step in. Exhausted, bitter; probably a bit down, after prolonged stretch of chaos and gloom! You are looking for novel, alternative life-living experiences, choices! The current madness is deep; remedial wisdom is complex and clarity of insight mired in mist of fake realities. This eBook is a process of simplifying solutions in melodious, lovable ways, with a magical togetherness, never engineered before. The eBook talks about complex life-living issues, with an aim to create novel and alternative ways to optimize beauty, bliss, brilliance and buoyancy in times of chaos and gloom. The knowledge, which shall create pathways to potentials, is also very complicated and huge. But, they have been simplified, with daily life examples. You have option to seek content suitable to your specific needs. Change is inevitable. However, often; wrong and undesirable changes happen, not because of lack of information but by partial, fake and half-baked information. In this eBook, we talk about life-living, novel and alternative changes, based on objective, holistic and scientifically updated information. We talk about how and why there is express need to reorient the populist and culturally dominated ideas and idealism of success, richness, relationship, intimacy and many other life-living ‘realities’. Special care has been taken to simplify complex ideas and processes, with examples from life-living experiences. The eBook is unique in the sense that it extends you the choice to personalize it by ensuring, what content you want to have, suiting your needs and personal fittingness. Everything is Information and all constituents and parts, forming this infinite plexus and system of Information, including humans, have only one identity – We are Fields, Landscapes, Information; within the colossal reality of infinite cosmos. This awareness is maturity. The practice of this reality is actually being alive. Only alive can understand grammar of life and poetry of living. Our consciousness has the potential to show us the realities of the cosmos and even beyond. We only kill its true potentials by restricting information to it only from a very small and localized milieu. Knowledge and its internalization open up and expand the milieus and it aligns us with the vastness of Information in the wider landscape of the cosmos. Larger and wider the Information landscape, better and greater is the potential of consciousness to create realities of novel and alternative experiences to us. This is the Grammar of Life. We shall elaborate all aspects of this grammar in this eBook. The Poetry of Living involves this very critical but exclusively personal ingredient of Awareness, its internalization and holistic usage to process out integration and assimilation of myriads of elements (information) in internal and external milieus. Many people have the knowledge of Grammar but very few can create Poetry. This happens as they are good at ingredients but not as good and successful at processes. We talk about these processes here in details, with examples and daily-life experiences to facilitate understanding. At the very outset, we need to talk about ‘Reality’ of ‘Success’ and ‘Richness’. The wise of humanity tells us that true success and richness of life-living is not in money, power, fame and consumption. It is in quantitative and qualitative abundance of probabilistic experiences of myriad shades and hues of Realities. These are complex ideas but this eBook has made it simple and easy. I humbly assure; this eBook shall make you truly rich and successful.

Transfigurations,['Asbjørn Grønstad'],"In many senses, viewers have cut their teeth on the violence in American cinema: from Anthony Perkins slashing Janet Leigh in the most infamous of shower scenes; to the 1970s masterpieces of Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and Francis Ford Coppola; to our present-day undertakings in imagining global annihilations through terrorism, war, and alien grudges. Transfigurations brings our cultural obsession with film violence into a renewed dialogue with contemporary theory. Grønstad argues that the use of violence in Hollywood films should be understood semiotically rather than viewed realistically; Tranfigurations thus alters both our methodology of reading violence in films and the meanings we assign to them, depicting violence not as a self-contained incident, but as a convoluted network of our own cultural ideologies and beliefs.",278.0,['Performing Arts'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WZQDIlC4QP0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WZQDIlC4QP0C&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=394&source=gbs_api,"Violence, Death and Masculinity in American Cinema",No link available

Arid Land Systems: Sciences and Societies,"['Troy Sternberg', 'Ariell Ahearn']","Understanding deserts and drylands is essential, as arid landscapes cover >40% of the Earth and are home to two billion people. Today's problematic environment–human interaction needs contemporary knowledge to address dryland complexity. Physical dimensions in arid zones—land systems, climate and hazards, ecology—are linked with social processes that directly impact drylands, such as land management, livelihoods, and development. The challenges require integrated research that identifies systemic drivers across global arid regions. Measurement and monitoring, field investigation, remote sensing, and data analysis are effective tools to investigate natural dynamics. Equally, inquiry into how policy and practice affect landscape sustainability is key to mitigating detrimental activity in deserts. Relations between socio-economic forces and degradation, agro-pastoral rangeland use, drought and disaster and resource extraction reflect land interactions. Contemporary themes of food security, conflict, and conservation are interlinked in arid environments. This book unifies desert science, arid environments, and dryland development. The chapters identify land dynamics, address system risks and delineate human functions through original research in arid zones. Mixed methodologies highlight the vital links between social and environmental science in global deserts. The book engages with today's topical themes and presents novel analyses of arid land systems and societies.",380.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cPWpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cPWpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=403&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Spectral Arctic,['Shane McCorristine'],"Visitors to the Arctic enter places that have been traditionally imagined as otherworldly. This strangeness fascinated audiences in nineteenth-century Britain when the idea of the heroic explorer voyaging through unmapped zones reached its zenith. The Spectral Arctic re-thinks our understanding of Arctic exploration by paying attention to the importance of dreams and ghosts in the quest for the Northwest Passage. The narratives of Arctic exploration that we are all familiar with today are just the tip of the iceberg: they disguise a great mass of mysterious and dimly lit stories beneath the surface. In contrast to oft-told tales of heroism and disaster, this book reveals the hidden stories of dreaming and haunted explorers, of frozen mummies, of rescue balloons, visits to Inuit shamans, and of the entranced female clairvoyants who travelled to the Arctic in search of John Franklin’s lost expedition. Through new readings of archival documents, exploration narratives, and fictional texts, these spectral stories reflect the complex ways that men and women actually thought about the far North in the past. This revisionist historical account allows us to make sense of current cultural and political concerns in the Canadian Arctic about the location of Franklin’s ships.",278.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vZVaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vZVaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=423&source=gbs_api,A History of Dreams and Ghosts in Polar Exploration,No link available
Mola ... Person,['Lynn Veach Sadler'],"“A lesson in history, almost. A lesson in anthropology, tradition, and roots, almost. A lesson in the power of poetry to rend and blend reality and imagination until they become indistinguishable from each other, certainly. Who is the clone of whom? Who is the real child and grown-up artist? Dr. Lynn Veach Sadler’s exquisite handling of language tools and penetrating research into the subject matter of this chapbook and her unique way of mixing what we know and what we think we know provide us with a landscape that necessitates only the closing of eyes in order to transport us to this world of blurred colors and blurred consciousness.

As Publisher of several of her history-researched poems the past few years, I find Mola ...

Poems of Guido Gezelle,['Paul Vincent'],"The Bruges-born poet-priest Guido Gezelle(1830–1899) is generally considered one of the masters of nineteenth-century European lyric poetry. At the end of his life and in the first two decades of the twentieth century, Gezellewas hailed by the avant-garde as the founder of modern Flemish poetry. His unique voice was belatedly recognised in the Netherlands and often compared with his English contemporary Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–1889). In this bilingual anthology, award-winning translator Paul Vincent selects a representative picture of Gezelle’soutput, from devotional through narrative, to celebratory and expressionistic. Gezelle’sfavourite themes are childhood, the Flemish landscape, friendship, nature, religion and the Flemish vernacular, and his apparently simple poems conceal a sophisticated prosody and a dialogue with spiritual and literary tradition.However, an important barrier to wider international recognition of his lyric genius up to now has been the absence of translations that do justice to the vigour and musicality of Gezelle’sWest Flemish idiom. Two of the translations included go some way to redressing the balance: ‘TheWatter-Scriever’ by Scotland’s national poet Edwin Morgan and ‘A Little Leaf . . .’ by Francis Jones. Both translators make brilliant use of their own vernaculars (Glaswegian and North Yorkshire respectively) to bring Gezelleto life for the non-Dutch-speaking reader.",253.0,['Poetry'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pUZLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pUZLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=427&source=gbs_api,A Bilingual Anthology,No link available
"BUCKLEY, BATMAN & MYNDIE: Echoes of the Victorian culture-clash frontier",Unknown,"Sounding 7 begins with Echo 107 titled CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN EYES ON THE OZ CULTURE-CLASH FRONTIER followed by echoes on BUCKLEY REVISITED, AFTER THE PROTECTORATE CRUMBLED and WHAT OF PROTECTOR ROBINSON? Echoes follow on salvaging tribal ways, the Merri Creek black orphanage, ‘going round the bend’ at the Asylum and Echo 114: THE CELESTIALS OF VICTORIA, being the resented Chinese gold miners. Exploring the contrasting fate of Batman, La Trobe and Derrimut, leads into echoes on fringe-dwelling, cultural resistance and Oz racism, in particular the mass psychology of racist ideology that culminated with World War 2. After the gold rush era, life and right behaviour at the Healesville Coranderrk mission station and re-thinking William Thomas the Aboriginal Guardian lead to the pleasant notion of civilizing British colonies through sport. The life and exploits of Tom Wills is celebrated in Echo 122: THE MAKING & BREAKING OF VICTORIA’S FIRST SPORTING HERO. Turning to political history, Oz class struggles – convicts, capitalism and nation-building asks the question with Echo 124: WHITHER MARXISM [?] and then BRITISH EMPIRE POLICY REFORMS IN THE 1840s to contain a Chartist-led revolution. Facets of Victorian ‘quality of life’ since the land grab are followed by echoes on the astrology of the 1802 Port Phillip Crown possession claim and an echo titled TOWARDS AN ASTROLOGY OF CIVILIZATION. The Sounding concludes with approaches to researching Aboriginal society, an undergraduate essay on the Dreamtime and finally with Echo 130: A RAINBOW SERPENT BRIDGE. Today in the 21s century, I wonder how differently Oz would have developed if the then ruling British government in Sydney and London had not used censorship to delay the gold rush for almost 40 years! Sounding 8 begins with Echo 131: HISTORY DISTORTION & CENSORSHIP and is backed up with a critique of Britannia’s pirate empire that together spawn two more echoes of doubtful but controversial polemics in 1421 – THE YEAR CHINA DISCOVERED THE WORLD suggesting they were here in Oz many centuries before Captain Cook. Echo 135: THE KADAITCHA SUNG MEETS THE DRUID INHERITANCE pits Palm Islander Sam Watson’s 1990s fiction The Kadaitcha Sung [the ‘clever’ occult Oz Dreamtime] in occult war with the equally ancient European / Celtic / Druid magic in the psyche of the Aryan ‘race’, so to speak. Going even further out on a limb, the focus shifts to recent light shed on ‘dark ages barbarians’ now considered by some historians to have been more culturally refined than the modern city individual. Back in Oz with Echo 137: WHITE MAN’S LAW – BLACKFELLOW LAW and Echo 138: McLEOD’S BUCKET FROM SKULL CREEK brings Western Australia after WW2 into wider awareness with the Pilbara pastoral workers strike of 1946-49 that won half-decent wage rights for Aboriginal stockmen.

The Absent Presence of the State in Large-Scale Resource Extraction Projects,"['Nicholas A. Bainton', 'Emilia E. Skrzypek']","Standing on the broken ground of resource extraction settings, the state is sometimes like a chimera: its appearance and intentions are misleading and, for some actors, it is unknowable and incomprehensible. It may be easily mistaken for someone or something else, like a mining company, for example. With rich ethnographic material, this volume tackles critical questions about the nature of contemporary states, studied from the perspective of resource extraction projects in Papua New Guinea, Australia and beyond. It brings together a sustained focus on the unstable and often dialectical relationship between the presence and the absence of the state in the context of resource extraction. Across the chapters, contributors discuss cases of proposed mining ventures, existing large-scale mining operations and the extraction of natural gas. Together, they illustrate how the concept of absent presence can be brought to life and how it can enhance our understanding of the state as well as relations and processes forming in extractive contexts, thus providing a novel contribution to the anthropology of the state and the anthropology of extraction. ‘The Absent Presence fills a major gap in our knowledge about the relationship between states and companies – at a time when resource extraction seems to be more contested than ever. Bainton and Skrzypek have curated an incredibly impressive volume that should be read by all those interested in exploring corporate and state power, and the ever-present impacts of extraction. A highly recommended read.’ — Professor Deanna Kemp, Director of the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining, The University of Queensland ‘Countless books have been written on the sovereign state and how it imposes a particular kind of order on economic and social interactions. What is original and compelling about this collection is the portrait of how two very different states converge when it comes to “extractive ventures”. From the presumption of exclusive sovereignty over mineral resources, to the bargains that are struck with major (often global) corporations, and the relative indifference to environmental impacts, there is a remarkable consistency in the patterns that are referred to as “state effects”. These effects are brought from the background to the foreground in this book through the blending of creative and critical thinking with detailed empirical research.’ — Tim Dunne, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Professor of International Relations, The University of Queensland ‘This brilliant and intriguing title provides a timely contribution to understanding the actual functions and strategies of state (and state-like) institutions in resource arenas. The dialectics of presence-absence and its refractions at different levels and scales of government allow the authors to go beyond stereotypes about the (strong, weak, failed or corrupt) state, highlighting more commonalities than expected between Papua New Guinea and Australia, and even New Caledonia.’ — Dr Pierre-Yves Le Meur, Anthropologist, Senior Researcher, French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development, Joint Research Unit SENS (Knowledge Environment Society)",380.0,['Technology & Engineering'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S2o8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=S2o8EAAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=432&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Post-Human Society,['Rajani Kanth'],"The Post-Human Society is a rich, unique, path-breaking, belletristic and literary 'crie de coeur' work - a lyrical expose of all the internal infelicities (social, political, aesthetic) of the United States of America. In its vivid contrasting of the mores of competition, avarice, and greed to communitarian, co-respecting and co-operative values, it abounds with colorful, vibrant, breathtaking images and tropes. Utilizing a novel, First Person Narrative, the author Rajani Kanth offers a poignant critique of the rabid, runaway materialism that has been the bane of all modernist, European societies, to date. It is evocative in its approach to the fading genre of the iconic anthropology/sociology classics of the yesteryear. Ultimately, it is a critique of the ruling ethos of our times: Eurocentrism - i.e., selfish and acquisitive materialism, of which the contemporary USA is the trend-setter and the unchallenged gold standard.

Non-humans in Social Science,"['Karolína Pauknerová', 'Marco Stella', 'Petr Gibas']","The book explores the issue of non-humans and their role and position within contemporary social sciences. Inspired by current trends of bridging the dichotomy of nature and culture, the authors use the “non-human“ as a prism that offers a different perspective of the world, society, culture, and last but not least, being(s). To start paying attention to non-humans has the potential to hybridize social sciences and in turn enrich them as well as to offer social scientists novel perspectives and tools to approach social phenomena. Such an attitude might in turn lead to a reassessment of understanding of the relationship between the world and being, and of the categories of being and subject. Hence the potential of non-humans to stimulate an ontological shift within social sciences. The view of the “human” and “non-human” as oppositional categories is a remnant of essentially modernist thinking. This book represents a response in terms of an attempt to think about humans and non-humans outside of the binary division. The authors thus want to contribute to the hybridization of social sciences and throughout the book they deal with ontological, epistemological and thematical shifts stemming from the hybridization. If the non-human does not exist as a negation, the boundary between the two becomes unclear and overlapping. It is with this hybridization, the blurring of the boundaries, that we are able to come closer to those who inhabit the world: non-humans and humans alike.",353.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bwv-CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bwv-CAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=439&source=gbs_api,"Ontologies, Theories and Case Studies",No link available
The Road,['Jack London'],"There is a woman in the state of Nevada to whom I once lied continuously, consistently, and shamelessly, for the matter of a couple of hours. I don't want to apologize to her. Far be it from me. But I do want to explain. Unfortunately, I do not know her name, much less her present address. If her eyes should chance upon these lines, I hope she will write to me. It was in Reno, Nevada, in the summer of 1892. Also, it was fair-time, and the town was filled with petty crooks and tin-horns, to say nothing of a vast and hungry horde of hoboes. It was the hungry hoboes that made the town a ""hungry"" town. They ""battered"" the back doors of the homes of the citizens until the back doors became unresponsive. A hard town for ""scoffings,"" was what the hoboes called it at that time. I know that I missed many a meal, in spite of the fact that I could ""throw my feet"" with the next one when it came to ""slamming a gate"" for a ""poke-out"" or a ""set-down,"" or hitting for a ""light piece"" on the street. Why, I was so hard put in that town, one day, that I gave the porter the slip and invaded the private car of some itinerant millionnaire.",248.0,['Tramps'],4.0,9.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ahNbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ahNbAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=441&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ahNbAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-ahNbAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Retirement Timing and Social Stratification,['Jonas Radl'],"The monograph disseminates the very topical issue of retirement and its timing as the key to one of the greatest challenges facing ageing societies. Postponing retirement is now almost universally regarded as indispensable in order to relieve European welfare states from the demography-related financial pressures. This seminal study, derived from a statistical analysis of a large-scale survey data, provides a thorough understanding of the micro- and macro-level determinants of retirement timing in contemporary Western Europe. The book is the first monograph to combine the analysis of the retirement attitudes with the analysis of the retirement behaviour within one research. It tackles the question as to whether early retirement can be explained by “early exit culture”, triangulating life course theory with a social stratification approach. The author used a novel and innovative approach to obtain the results. The methodology includes: tobit models of proscriptive age norms; simulations of the impact of class structure on a country’s average retirement age; competing risks models of different work-exit modalities; duration selection models of retirement timing.",329.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l6MoCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l6MoCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=442&source=gbs_api,A Comparative Study of Labor Market Exit and Age Norms in Western Europe,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l6MoCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-l6MoCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Additionally, Coleridge establishes his view that good poetry?does not necessarily have to be written in ""the language of men,"" as Wordsworth?suggested.

Optics in Our Time,"['Mohammad D. Al-Amri', 'Mohamed El-Gomati', 'M. Suhail Zubairy']","Light and light based technologies have played an important role in transforming our lives via scientific contributions spanned over thousands of years. In this book we present a vast collection of articles on various aspects of light and its applications in the contemporary world at a popular or semi-popular level. These articles are written by the world authorities in their respective fields. This is therefore a rare volume where the world experts have come together to present the developments in this most important field of science in an almost pedagogical manner. This volume covers five aspects related to light. The first presents two articles, one on the history of the nature of light, and the other on the scientific achievements of Ibn-Haitham (Alhazen), who is broadly considered the father of modern optics. These are then followed by an article on ultrafast phenomena and the invisible world. The third part includes papers on specific sources of light, the discoveries of which have revolutionized optical technologies in our lifetime. They discuss the nature and the characteristics of lasers, Solid-state lighting based on the Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology, and finally modern electron optics and its relationship to the Muslim golden age in science. The book’s fourth part discusses various applications of optics and light in today's world, including biophotonics, art, optical communication, nanotechnology, the eye as an optical instrument, remote sensing, and optics in medicine. In turn, the last part focuses on quantum optics, a modern field that grew out of the interaction of light and matter. Topics addressed include atom optics, slow, stored and stationary light, optical tests of the foundation of physics, quantum mechanical properties of light fields carrying orbital angular momentum, quantum communication, and Wave-Particle dualism in action.",504.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GtlCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GtlCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR3&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=450&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GtlCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-GtlCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Poems at the Edge of Differences,['Renate Papke'],"This study consists of two parts. The first part offers an overview of feminism's theory of differences. The second part deals with the textual analysis of poems about 'mothering' by women from India, the Caribbean and Africa. Literary criticism has dealt with the representation of 'mothering' in prose texts. The exploration of lyrical texts has not yet come. Since the late 1970s, the acknowledgement of and the commitment to difference has been foundational for feminist theory and activism. This investigation promotes a differentiated, 'locational' feminism (Friedman). The comprehensive theoretical discussion of feminism's different concepts of 'gender', 'race', 'ethnicity' and 'mothering' builds the foundation for the main part: the presentation and analysis of the poems. The issue of 'mothering' foregrounds the communicative aspect of women's experience and wants to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This study, however, does not intend to specify 'mothering' as a universal and unique feminine characteristic. It underlines a metaphorical use and discusses the concepts of 'nurturing', 'maternal practice' and 'social parenthood'. Regarding the extensive material, this study understands itself as an explorative not concluding investigation placed at the intersections of gender studies, postcolonial and classical literary studies. Most of all, it aims at initiating a dialogue and interchange between scholars and students in the Western and the 'Third World'.",217.0,['Social Science'],4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2ayKA7Dq8EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A2ayKA7Dq8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=451&source=gbs_api,Mothering in New English Poetry by Women,No link available
The Press in New Order Indonesia,['David T. Hill'],"The Press in New Order Indonesia is the most comprehensive book available in English on the print media during the Suharto presidency. Based on detailed and investigative research, it provides a succinct introduction to the political and economic forces shaping this dominant sector of the Indonesian media at a pivotal time in its development. The study documents the history of the press prior to the rise of President Suharto, surveys the changing New Order policies to the media, and analyses the various modes of control exercised through powerful government agencies and industry bodies. Throughout this critical historical period of political tension and economic transition, The Press in New Order Indonesia traces the development of huge media conglomerates which began to rival military muscle in shaping the media landscape of Indonesia. This study explains how the student press spilled off the campuses to play a unique political role. By contrast, a distinctly Islamic press achieved only very modest success. Focusing on Indonesian-language national daily newspapers, it also discusses news weeklies, periodicals and magazines, as well as publications in regional languages, English and Chinese. Brought back to life in Equinox Publishing's Classic Indonesia series, The Press in New Order Indonesia is required reading for students of Indonesian languages and cultures, Asian studies, Southeast Asian studies, media studies, journalism, and contemporary politics.

Sargent,['T. Martin Wood'],"An essay about the painter John Singer Sargent from a contemporary that knew him. Excerpt from the book: I once had occasion to call on Mr. Sargent, and was shown into a room with a black carpet. Only a colourist loves black, and sees it as a colour. And this room, so free from all that was novel and without associations, helped to explain to me why, though his method is so modern and of the moment, his pictures of aristocrats accommodate themselves to ancestral surroundings. For it is true that not only the face and the clothes of his sitters are given, but somehow, in the material of paint, their social position and their distinction. Supreme is the art of Sargent in its appreciation of those pleasures which would almost seem for art alone. Perhaps the next generation will feel that it owes more to him than to any painter of this time.",58.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c46wDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=c46wDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=453&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c46wDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-c46wDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Digital Humanities and Literary Studies,['Martin Paul Eve'],"A comprehensive overview into digital literary studies that equips readers to navigate the difficult contentions in this space. The Literary Agenda is a series of short polemical monographs about the importance of literature and of reading in the wider world and about the state of literary education inside schools and universities. The category of 'the literary' has always been contentious. What is clear, however, is how increasingly it is dismissed or is unrecognised as a way of thinking or an arena for thought. It is sceptically challenged from within, for example, by the sometimes rival claims of cultural history, contextualized explanation, or media studies. It is shaken from without by even greater pressures: by economic exigency and the severe social attitudes that can follow from it; by technological change that may leave the traditional forms of serious human communication looking merely antiquated. For just these reasons this is the right time for renewal, to start reinvigorated work into the meaning and value of literary reading. You may have heard of the digital humanities--and what you may have heard may not have been good. Yet like an oncoming storm, the relentless growth of the use of digital methods for the study of literature seems inevitable. This book gives an insight into the ways in which digital approaches can be used to study literature and the ways in which humanistic study can be used to explore digital literature. Examining its subject across the axes of authorship, space, and visualization, maps and place, distance and history, and ethical approaches to the digital humanities, this book introduces newcomers to the topic while also offering plenty for seasoned digital humanities pros. Combining original research with third-party case studies and examples, this book will appeal both to students and researchers across all levels who wish to learn about digital literary studies.",197.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F1lVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=F1lVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=454&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Institutions for integrated water-resources management in river basins: An analytical framework,"['Kurian, Mathew']","In recent years, Integrated Water-Resources Management (IWRM) has captured the attention of policymakers and policy analysts. A lot has been written, most often in a disparate way about institutions for IWRM. However, there has been limited success in bridging disciplinary boundaries (social versus physical sciences) with the result that conceptual inconsistencies persist with regard to our understanding of institutions for IWRM. This paper reviews IWMI research on IWRM in Asia and highlights drawbacks in contemporary approaches to the study of institutions for IWRM in river basins. The paper then outlines key features of an alternative analytical framework. In doing so, it discusses certain novel features of the alternative approach: emphasis on transparent policy processes of State parastatals, modes of water-service provisioning and conditions for collective action in the management of common-pool resources in river basins and its implications for sustainable rural livelihoods.",27.0,['Integrated water development'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxVE29wSS8gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nxVE29wSS8gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=457&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Identity: Quest and Questions,['Raisun Mathew'],"This academic edited volume analyses and interprets the constantly altering meaning(s) and expression(s) of identity in the context of rising tensions and conflicts caused by society's dominant power structures on vulnerable and victimised groups. The question of identity that arises in a person gets into conflict with the social structures that complicate the notion at every instant of developing newer definitions of existence in the multifaceted world. These social constructs, either directly or indirectly, employing persuasion or coercion, and through manoeuvre or manipulation, develop to deviate from the expected normative identity possessed to knowingly or unknowingly embrace the ‘other’ identity. The freedom to continue in one's own identity or freely transit between identities without the stains of society’s constructs is critical, thus resulting in the debates and questions raised by/on/for identity. It is equally important to understand the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of the notion of identity that influence and get influenced by the connected spheres of gender dysphoria, patriarchal ascendance, cultural diversity and construction, uncertainties and conflicts of diaspora, alterity and entrapment, migration and displacement, caste oppression, vulnerability and victimisation, state apparatuses, and subalternity. Through multifarious themes and topics of discussion related to exploring the notion of identity, this book converges the diverse perspectives on various situational existences of people. Thus, an elaborate and wider angle on the transitions and formation of identity is captured to decipher the relevance and significance of identity.",31.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TpGFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TpGFEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=464&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Yeats's Legacies,['Warwick Gould'],"The two great Yeats Family Sales of 2017 and the legacy of the Yeats family’s 80-year tradition of generosity to Ireland’s great cultural institutions provide the kaleidoscope through which these advanced research essays find their theme. Hannah Sullivan’s brilliant history of Yeats’s versecraft challenges Poundian definitions of Modernism; Denis Donoghue offers unique family memories of 1916 whilst tracing the political significance of the Easter Rising; Anita Feldman addresses Yeats’s responses to the Rising’s appropriation of his symbols and myths, the daring artistry of his ritual drama developed from Noh, his poetry of personal utterance, and his vision of art as a body reborn rather than a treasure preserved amid the testing of the illusions that hold civilizations together in ensuing wars. Warwick Gould looks at Yeats as founding Senator in the new Free State, and his valiant struggle against the literary censorship law of 1929 (with its present-day legacy of Irish anti-blasphemy law still presenting a constitutional challenge). Drawing on Gregory Estate documents, James Pethica looks at the evictions which preceded Yeats’s purchase of Thoor Ballylee in Galway; Lauren Arrington looks back at Yeats, Ezra Pound, and the Ghosts of The Winding Stair (1929) in Rapallo. Having co-edited both versions of A Vision, Catherine Paul offers some profound reflections on ‘Yeats and Belief’. Grevel Lindop provides a pioneering view of Yeats’s impact on English mystical verse and on Charles Williams who, while at Oxford University Press, helped publish the Oxford Book of Modern Verse. Stanley van der Ziel looks at the presence of Shakespeare in Yeats’s Purgatory. William H. O’Donnell examines the vexed textual legacy of his late work, On the Boiler while Gould considers the challenge Yeats’s intentionalism posed for once-fashionable post-structuralist editorial theory. John Kelly recovers a startling autobiographical short story by Maud Gonne. While nine works of current biographical, textual and literary scholarship are reviewed, Maud Gonne is the focus of debate for two reviewers, as are Eva Gore-Booth, Constance and Casimir Markievicz, Rudyard Kipling, David Jones, T.

The Indigenous Identity of the South Saami,"['Håkon Hermanstrand', 'Asbjørn Kolberg', 'Trond Risto Nilssen', 'Leiv Sem']","This open access book is a novel contribution in two ways: It is a multi-disciplinary examination of the indigenous South Saami people in Fennoscandia, a social and cultural group that often is overlooked as it is a minority within the Saami minority. Based on both historical material such as archaeological evidence, 20th century newspapers, and postcard motives as well as current sources such as ongoing land-right trials and recent works of historiography, the articles highlight the culture and living conditions of this indigenous group, mapping the negotiations of different identities through the interaction of Saami and non-Saami people through the ages. By illuminating this under-researched field, the volume also enriches the more general debate on global indigenous history, and sheds light on the construction of a Scandinavian identity and the limits of the welfare state and the myth of heterogeneity and equality.",186.0,['Foreign Language Study'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uymGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uymGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=477&source=gbs_api,Historical and Political Perspectives on a Minority within a Minority,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uymGDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uymGDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia","['Bruno David', 'Paul Taçon', 'Jean-Jacques Delannoy', 'Jean-Michel Geneste']","Western Arnhem Land, in the Top End of Australia’s Northern Territory, has a rich archaeological landscape, ethnographic record and body of rock art that displays an astonishing array of imagery on shelter walls and ceilings. While the archaeology goes back to the earliest period of Aboriginal occupation of the continent, the rock art represents some of the richest, most diverse and visually most impressive regional assemblages anywhere in the world. To better understand this multi-dimensional cultural record, The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia focuses on the nature and antiquity of the region’s rock art as revealed by archaeological surveys and excavations, and the application of novel analytical methods. This volume also presents new findings by which to rethink how Aboriginal peoples have socially engaged in and with places across western Arnhem Land, from the north to the south, from the plains to the spectacular rocky landscapes of the plateau. The dynamic nature of Arnhem Land rock art is explored and articulated in innovative ways that shed new light on the region’s deep time Aboriginal history.",527.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EFFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5EFFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=482&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Goethe's Theory of Colours,['Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'],"This work by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) was translated into English in 1840 by Sir Charles Eastlake (1793-1865), painter and later keeper of the National Gallery. Goethe's 1810 work was rejected by many contemporary scientists because it appeared to contradict the physical laws laid down by Newton. However, its focus on the human perception of the colour spectrum, as opposed to the observable optical phenomenon, was attractive to, and influential upon, artists and philosophers. As Eastlake says in his preface, the work's dismissal on scientific grounds had caused 'a well-arranged mass of observations and experiments, many of which are important and interesting', to be overlooked. Eastlake also puts Goethe's work into its aesthetic and scientific context and describes its original reception.

Emil Von Behring,['Derek S. Linton'],"In 1901 Emil von Behring received the first Nobel Prize in medicine for serum therapy against diphtheria, a disease that killed thousands of infants annually. Diphtheria serum was the first major cure of the bacteriological era & its development generated novel procedures for testing, standardizing, & regulating drugs. Since the intro. of antibiotics, Behring & his work have largely been forgotten. In the first English-language scientific biography of Behring, Derek S. Linton seeks to restore Behring's reputation. He emphasizes Behring's seminal contributions to the study of infectious disease, the formation of modern immunology, & innovative research on specific remedies & vaccines against deadly microbial infections. Behring's research program is placed within the context of Imperial Germany's vibrant scientific culture. This biography explores his complex relations to the rival bacteriological schools of Robert Koch in Berlin & Louis Pasteur in Paris, the emergent German pharmaceutical industry, & the institutionalization of experimental therapeutic research.

Revisiting Modernism,['Maria-Ana Tupan '],"By shifting the centre of gravity from author to reader, Roland Barthes had certainly prepared us for a Copernican turn in aesthetics, yet Michael J. Pearce’s Art in the Age of Emergence still sounds unfamiliar two years after its publication. While acknowledging the existence of homologies among the art objects of a cultural phase, the Californian academic also launches an explanatory hypothesis:”I realized that in order to understand art, instead of looking for the similarities between the paintings and the sculptures we have to look at the similarities between the people looking at them. Art is better explained by looking at how the mind works than by looking at the products of mind.”(XV). The substitution of the phenomenology of mind for the phenomenology of the work of art can only have a partial contribution to the understanding of period terms, yet not devoid of relevance. The numerous studies in modernism published of late, for instance, are revisionary, the changing views being motivated by the new historical context rather than by a new assessment of forms. The mind turns out to be working acording to the critical theory it has been exposed to or which it has freely embraced. Relegated to the status of socio-political movement without aesthetic significance since 1939, when Clement Greenberg associated it with kitsch, to Renato Poggioli, Peter Bürger or Christopher Butler (Early Modernism: Literature, Music, and Painting in Europe, 1900-1916, 1994), the avant-garde came to be enshrined as the weightiest artistic phenomenon and “the last post of modernism” by Richard Sheppard in Modernism-Dada-Postmodernism (2000), who joined thus a new party of postmodern critics, among whom, Linda Hutcheon, who see the historical avant-garde as the generative matrix of the post-war literature in the 50s and the 60s, stretching the term to include the French nouveau roman or the Tel Quel. Quoted by Sheppard on Marx’s Communist Manifesto being “the first great modernist work of art”, Marshall Berman (All That Is Solid Melts into Air, 1982) too welcomes modernism into the sixties and seventies. Titles, such as, Avant Garde and After: Rethinking Art Now, by Brandon Taylor, have tilted the scales measuring modernism against the avant-garde into a more balanced position, even if also the leads of the earlier twentieth century have been the object of New-Historicist and culturalist approaches that corrected the Axel Castle icon of egocentric aloofness through readings that evinced the substantial presence of history in the writings of Woolf, Joyce or D. H. Lawrence. With interdisicplinarity the latest buzz word in the academic world, lots of studies have been dedicated to the influence of Non-Euclidian Geometry, relativity and quantum physics on modernist art, for instance, Surrealism, Art and Modern Science. Relativity, Quantum Mechanics,Epistemology by Gavin Parkinson (2008). The most spectacular renovation has probably been undergone by no other than Charles Baudelaire, the founding father, who has been removed from his site with transcendent flavours and symbolic correspondences and inserted into the phantasmagoric pre-cinematic media world : Marit Grotta: Baudelaire's Media Aesthetics (The Gaze of the Flâneur and 19-th Century Media). If we travel back in time to get a feeling of what modernists saw in each other and compare their vision with such contemporary framing, we realize to what extent the history of reception modifies the history of composition. Mina Loy’s ekphrasis of sculptor Brancusi’s Golden Bird, for instance, conveys the modernist artist’s infatuation with archetypes, tropes of immaculate conception, “breast of revelation”or hyperaesthesia – the alchemy whereby the senses projected a secondary reality of mixed perceptions. Is there a possibility to negotiate meanings when talking to the dead, as Stephen Greenblatt has put it in the opening of Shakespearean Negotiations? Used also by Ayendy Bonifacio in his essay on Hart Crane,” interliterariness” is a middle-European term for what Russian semioticians or French and American social critics or American New Historicists had already attempted to achieve: an archeology of meaning, a history and a philosophy of culture that help the visitor of past ages assess meaning and value. The more elements of a culture’s codes are absorbed into an art object, the more representative and valuable is its testimony in the history of the spirit. Understanding such ”serious and heavy” codes, as Pound dubbed them, takes longer, studies of a work’s genealogy bringing it to light in all its complexity. The history of literature is replete with such novas, Irish Flann O’Brien, whose works are an ark of his time’s literary, aesthetic, scientific or political ideas, is the revelation of the last decade, emerging almost out of anonymity thanks to systematic research initiated by a team coordinated by Professor Werner Huber from the University of Vienna. Whether the Virgilian guide be New Historicist Greenblatt, or, as suggested by Professor Sachin C. Ketkar in his essay, Lotman’s semiotics or Dionyz Durisin’s study of the discursive exchanges of semantic energy across national boundaries, it becomes possible, for instance, to read Mardhekar in the context of the international modernist movements and in light of ”interliterary ‘genetic-contactual relations’ instead of the idea of ‘influence’ which invariably brings in normative hierarchy between the influencer and the influenced, placing the latter on a lower or secondary position.” In the beginning, building international communities was indeed a matter of hierarchies of power. Japan or China were forced to open their harbours to international trade, coming out of their ancestral isolation, while the Macaulay law forced Indians into chimeric native bodies and Emglish minds. Merchants or colonizers, however, opened the way to enlightened politicians, scientists or artists. In his History of Romanian Civilization, Eugen Lovinescu, critic and editor of the earlier twentieth century, distinguishes between evolutionary and revolutionary models of culture. The major cultures know a continuous and organic growth, whereas minor ones, lured by centres of influence, break off abrupty from their traditions borrowing foreign models. That is why it is easy to date period terms in the latter, whereas the former have very discreet lines of demarcation. Ezra Pound’s manifesto of imagism, for instance, is heavily indebted to Alfred Binet’s model of reasoning through associations of images instead of syllogisms, but ahead of Binet there was Herbart, and before Herbart, Kant, who had borrowed ideas for his Anthropology from David Hume ... It is again the constitution of homologies across disciplinary spheres and reciprocal loans that allow an observer to identify a territorialization, as Deleuze calls it, that is, a distinct type of culture. Politically speaking, modernism begins with Baudelaire’s declaration of war on the bourgeois: “Vous êtes la majorité, – nombre et intelligence ; – donc vous êtes la force, – qui est la justice.”(You are the majority - in number and intelligence; therefore you are the force – which is justice – Salon de 1846). With its nomination of the working class as being entitled to lead the other social classes – which they did when they had the chance – Marx’s Capital meant even less democracy than the bourgeois republic. The modernist political discourse was one of individualism and human rights, built on Jefferson’s model. It is this fascinating rebel against hypocritical social conventions that still appeals to the nonconformist youth cultures, Shweta Basu undertaking a study in the translation of “Flowers of Evil” across cultures and rmedia in a Japonese manga series. Modernism saw the collapse of dynasties, and the foundation of international leagues of nations enjoying equal rights or of clubs of the intellectual elites of all nations (PEN CLUB). E. M. Forster was writing in 1938: “I believe in aristocracy . . . Not an aristocracy of power, based upon rank and influence, but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky.” Under the circumstances of huge differences in point of civilization – Bipin Balachandran mentions the case of Poland and other middle and East-European countries – but capitalizing on the widely circulated narrative of the superiority of culture over civilization, which was considered to be rapidly changing into a soulless machinery, individual contacts of scholars or artists contributed to the emergence of a truly international spirit and a cosmopolitan culture. By contrast, the eighteenth century had thrived on models of justified hierarchies (the best of all possible worlds), colonizing missions, histories of empires to learn from them the rise to international power. The systematic oppositions we can establish between the Enlightenment and modernism prevent us from merging them into ”a singular modernity” (Frederic Jameson). The culture of modernism is a hybrid one, with metropolitan cultures fascinated by the new nations they were put in contact with, open to the foreigners who sought them out to study or pursue a career. Japanese art was studied and imitated, while the interest in India, aroused by the discovery of the common origin of Indo-European languages, by Schopenhauer’s philosophy or by Madame Balavatsky’s esoteric pursuits, emulated by the British and the Americans alike, reached such proportions that references to India almost became a sign of recognition. Even quantum physics pioneers, Heisenber and Schrὅdinger, owned a debt to Hindu mythology and the Indian logic of the included third. Naturally possessed of this mindset, physicist Satyendra Nath Bose initiated calculations of a new state of condensed matter, where atoms lose their identity reaching the peace of a frozen quantum state of superimposed waves. The experiment is known as the Bhose-Einstein condensate. A very fashionable topic of research nowadays, the search for native forms of modernism outside the centrality of Paris, London or New York is usually successful. Paraphrasing, scratch a national culture and you will find traces of modernism. It was not difficult for Rindon Kundu and Saswati Saha to spot out a Wagner in Latin America in the person of Rubén Darío, and even an aesthetic contest between him and Enrique González Martínez, similar to the Wyndham Lewis-Marinetti duel in Europe. For T.S. Eliot, India was a myth of origin from The Love Song of Alfred Prufrock to The Waste Land. As he confessed in a speech in memory of Rudyard Kipling, the former was inspired by The Love Song of Har Dyal. Eliot’s protagonist is spiritualy impoverished, frustrated by lack, not of love affairs but of strong feelings, like those that give lovers the courage to risk their lives in the Indian story. Anindita Mukherjee chooses another contextualization, out of many possible, as is the case with the erudite modernists, and that is Rilke’s thoughts on love disclosed to a young poet who had asked him for advice. In that letter, Rilke says that dragons are but princesses who want to see their lovers courageous. Prufrock is acutely aware of his inferiority in relation to bright, cultivated women, who comment on his weakness, while the imagery surrounding them suggests the strength of warrior-women (And I have known the arms already, known them all— /Arms that are braceleted). The essayist notices though the redemption of the protagonist, his final capacity to dismiss his daily routine as rubbish and reach for transcendence. Sumi Bora looks into textual traces of the relationship between the poet and his rhetorical masks, interrogating the status of the authorial figure and biography in the modernist text. The web of mythic allusions in The Waste Land is a familiar feature of the modernist agenda ”to seek reality and justice in a single vision (Yeats). Nisarga Bhattacharjee and Ananya Chatterjee write on the modernists’ use of myth as part of the mythopoetic tradition, blooming into extended metaphors of life or of the human condition, while Susan Haris is plumbing into the symbolism of unconscious drives and identification with elementary nature in D.H. Lawrence’s personal version of psychoanalysis. The figural psyche of modernist fiction and the gendered landscape of female isolation is Lava Asaad’s focus on the early modernist career of Jean Rhys, better known for her postcolonial rewriting of Jane Eyre. Is there an aesthetic continuity between the historical avant-garde and the Beat Generation or the abstract expressionism in the 50s and 60s? Allen Ginsberg, John Ashbery or Lawrence Ferlinghetti engage often in dialogue with precedent canonical texts, their intertexts sinning on the side of courteous attitudes to tradition, which does not fit into the context of Marinetti’s dismissal of libraries, academies and museums (The Futurist Manifesto). Abstract art is, obviously, something different from found objects, while, in critical theory, the fifties and the sixties saw the rise of semiotics, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, feminism, that is, of the very practice of interdisciplinarity in literary criticism, something at the other pole from New Criticism and other formalisms in which ended up structuralism. Although not irrelevant in point of aesthetic achievement, Ayendy Bonifacio writing persuasively on Hart Crane’s constructivist rhetoric, the avant-garde is still perceived as a self-standing chapter in the cultural history of modernism. The exchange of cultural narratives and traditions, fostered by historical circumstances but also by Worringer’s aesthetics that praised primitive art for its tendencies towards abstraction in flight from a threatening and alien nature, that could provide a spiritual cure to a materialistic civilization, was defining for the poetics of art at the turn of the last century. Modernism was humanity’s first coming together.",,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2cs5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2cs5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=489&source=gbs_api,Special Issue from the Spring Magazine on English Literature,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2cs5DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2cs5DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Posthuman Management,['Matthew E. Gladden'],"What are the best practices for leading a workforce in which human employees have merged cognitively and physically with electronic information systems and work alongside social robots, artificial life-forms, and self-aware networks that are ‘colleagues’ rather than simply ‘tools’? How does one manage organizational structures and activities that span actual and virtual worlds? How are the forces of technological posthumanization transforming the theory and practice of management? This volume explores the reality that an organization’s workers, managers, customers, and other stakeholders increasingly comprise a complex network of human agents, artificial agents, and hybrid human-synthetic entities. The first part of the book develops the theoretical foundations of an emerging ‘organizational posthumanism’ and presents frameworks for understanding and managing the evolving workplace relationship between human and synthetic beings. Other chapters investigate topics such as the likelihood that social robots might utilize charismatic authority to lead human workers; potential roles of AIs as managers of cross-cultural virtual teams; the ethics and legality of entrusting organizational decision-making to spatially diffuse robots that have no discernible physical form; quantitative approaches to comparing managerial capabilities of human and artificial agents; the creation of artificial life-forms that function as autonomous enterprises competing against human businesses; neural implants as gateways that allow human users to participate in new forms of organizational life; and the implications of advanced neuroprosthetics for information security and business model design. As the first comprehensive application of posthumanist methodologies to management, this volume will interest management scholars and management practitioners who must understand and guide the forces of technologization that are rapidly reshaping organizations’ form, dynamics, and societal roles.",442.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YSCADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YSCADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contemporary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=493&source=gbs_api,"Creating Effective Organizations in an Age of Social Robotics, Ubiquitous AI, Human Augmentation, and Virtual Worlds",No link available

Legacies and Ambiguities,"['Ernestine Schlant', 'J. Thomas Rimer']","The literary legacies of World War II have been mixed and varied, especially in West Germany and Japan, where the burden of defeat has been expressed by novelists and intellectuals in strikingly different ways. Reflecting the cultural differences between the two nations, and the experiences of occupation and democratization that occurred after the war, the postwar literatures of Germany and Japan intimately reveal the hopes and aspirations, the dreams and the nightmares, of two peoples confronting the harsh realities of war. Using a comparative approach, Ambiguous Legacies explores the conditions and values under which the postwar literatures of West Germany and Japan were created. Specifically, the book assesses the meaning of the German and Japanese literary responses to the World War II: the tendencies of denial or silence by German writers, the fatalism and passivity of Japanese novels, and the importance of the past in defining the recent ""New subjectivism"" among German writers and the outpourings of the ""Introverted Generation"" by Japanese novelists. Ernestine Schlant's introduction sets the context for the individual chapters and offers guideposts for further comparative scholarship.

Read till it shatters,['Thak Chaloemtiarana'],"This book introduces readers to modern Thai literature through the themes of modernity, nationalism, identity and gender. In the cultural, political and social transformations that occurred in Thailand during the first half of the twentieth century, Thai literature was one of the vehicles that moved the changes. Taking seriously ‘read till it shatters’, a Thai phrase that instructs readers to take apart the text, to break it down, to deconstruct it, Thak Chaloemtiarana challenges the Thai literary canon from the margins and suggests ways of expanding and enriching it. Thai literature is scarce in translation and requires the skills of a scholar fluent in Thai to comprehend it. Thak is a political scientist turned literary scholar who is bilingual in Thai and English and an avid reader of Thai fiction by authors up and down the social scale. Here he offers lively insights into his favourite literary genres with fresh readings of early Thai novels, Sino-Thai biographies and memoirs of the rich and famous. ‘Thak Chaloemtiarana is an inquisitive man. Late in his career he switched from politics to literature. In these chapters, he draws on a lifetime of reading about writers and writing in Thailand over the past century. He nods towards the usual big names—King Vajiravudh, Luang Wichit, Kulap Saipradit, Kukrit Pramoj—but spends more time on those found in the lesser visited stacks of the libraries, the secondhand bookstalls, and the shelf by the supermarket checkout. His themes are familiar—Thailand and the West, Thai nationalism, the Thai-Chinese, and women under patriarchy—but the angles of vision are original. With a cast ranging from motor-racing princes through sexy Egyptian mummies and a feminist serial murderer to starlets touting breast-enhancement techniques, this book educates, enlightens, and entertains.’",257.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OxFxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=OxFxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=45&source=gbs_api,Nationalism and identity in modern Thai literature,No link available

On the Literature and Thought of the German Classical Era,['Hugh Barr Nisbet'],"This volume provides a valuable contribution to our knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century intellectual life inside and outside Germany. —Prof. Karl S. Guthke, Harvard University This elegant collection of essays ranges across eighteenth and nineteenth-century thought, covering philosophy, science, literature and religion in the ‘Age of Goethe.’ A recognised authority in the field, Nisbet grapples with the major voices of the Enlightenment and gives pride of place to the figures of Lessing, Herder, Goethe and Schiller. These eleven essays range widely in their compass of thought and intellectual discourse, dealing incisively with themes including the philosophical implications of literature and the relationship between religion, science and politics. The result is an accomplished reflection on German thought, but also on its rebirth, as Nisbet argues for the relevance of these Enlightenment thinkers for the readers of today. The first half of this collection focuses predominantly on eighteenth-century thought, where names like Lessing, Goethe and Herder, but also Locke and Voltaire, feature. The second has a wider chronological scope, discussing authors such as Winckelmann and Schiller, while branching out from discussions of religion, philosophy and literature to explore the sciences. Issues of biology, early environmentalism, and natural history also form part of this volume. The collection concludes with an examination of changing attitudes towards art in the aftermath of the ‘Age of Goethe.’ The essays in this volume have been previously published separately, but are brought together in this collection to present Nisbet’s widely-acclaimed perspectives on this fascinating period of German thought. It will be of interest to scholars and students of the intellectual life of Europe during the Enlightenment, while its engaging and lucid style will also appeal to the general reader.",346.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7cUwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7cUwEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=99&source=gbs_api,Collected Essays,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7cUwEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7cUwEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

From Goethe to Gundolf,['Roger Paulin'],"From Goethe to Gundolf: Essays on German Literature and Culture is a collection of Roger Paulin’s groundbreaking essays, spanning the last forty years. The work represents his major research interests of Romanticism and the reception of Shakespeare in Germany, but also explores a broader range of themes, from poetry and the public memorialization of poets to fairy stories - all meticulously researched, yet highly accessible. As a comprehensive examination of German literary history in the period 1700-1900, the collection not only includes accounts of the lives and work of Goethe, Schiller, the Schlegels, and Gundolf (amongst others), serving to nuance our understanding of these figures in history, but also considers diverse (and often underexplored) topics, from academic freedom to the rise of travel literature. The essays have been reformulated, corrected, and updated to add references to recent works. However, the core foundations of the originals remain, and just as when they were first published, the value of these essays – to researchers, students, and all those who are interested in German literary history – cannot be overstated.",420.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S3g_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=S3g_EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=133&source=gbs_api,Essays on German Literature and Culture,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S3g_EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-S3g_EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Inheritance,['Susan Ferrier'],"First published in 1824, The Inheritance is the second novel by Susan Ferrier (1782-1854). Following the triumph of her more famous work Marriage (1818), The Inheritance picks up Ferrier's favoured theme of tried and tested morality. The focus here is on the fortunes of the young and innocent Gertrude St.Clair, who through the machinations of the desperate Mrs. St.Clair, leaves their home in France and arrives as heir apparent to the Scottish estate of Rossville. Contrary to the Earl of Rossville's plans however, Gertrude refuses the hand of the prepared suitor and instead falls under the spell of the ambitious and dashing Colonel Delmour. Ignoring the presence and guiding hand of the measured Edward Lyndsay who truly loves her, Gertrude throws herself into the bewitching gaieties of the fashionable world leaving all sense of duty behind her. Shadowing her light footsteps however is the figure of a mysterious and demanding stranger whose claim on Gertrude is to shape a very different future for her. Humanising the strain of evangelism in the novel is the inclusion of a collection of highly amusing and colourful characters, which, as noted in the new introduction, helps to display The Inheritance as 'a novel which shows Ferrier's skills as a satirist and caricaturist in their best light and that remains moreover one of the greatest examples of domestic fiction in the Scottish literary tradition'. --Ronnie Young.",,['Domestic fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=34Y-AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=34Y-AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=188&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=34Y-AQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-34Y-AQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

All the Words,['Maria Brandt'],"Maria Brandt’s novella All the Words is an artfully constructed collage of truth and memory, a wonderfully poetic story about the traumas that bind us to ourselves and each other. The simplicity of her language juxtaposed against the deceptive safety of a familiar landscape and the complications of childhood sorrow and denial produce an effect not unlike that of being on a speeding train, the same train her main character rides with her father as they struggle to confront what they can no longer avoid. Brandt is masterful at describing the paradoxical human desire to both erase and embrace the past in order to live more fully with and in spite of it. —Cathy Smith, author of The Glory Walk The characters in Maria Brandt’s heart-wise and home-wise All the Words struggle, each in their own way, to articulate all the necessary words. For in this lyrically lush and beautifully cadenced novella about a family’s love and loss, words are, paradoxically, precious and scarce. Sentences start but sputter out; mouths go mute; memories, both allusive and elusive, tease then disappear, only to reappear as fragmented textual ghosts, italicized and erupting throughout the course of this family’s journey—a journey from trauma to understanding, and, ultimately, to a kind of acceptance. Such a story arc is easy to describe, but painstakingly difficult to render dramatically and truthfully, but Brandt pulls it off with élan and intelligence and, best of all, the instincts of a natural storyteller. Read this short novel and feel what I felt: utterly renewed. —Joseph Salvatore, author of To Assume a Pleasing Shape In Maria Brandt’s All the Words, memory fuses with the present as a young woman journeys home to Long Island to confront the secrets and stories that haunted her transition into adolescence. Jane’s lens on the past is prismatic, splintering events into shards that she gradually and suspensefully tries to reassemble, even as the characters’ lives resist mending. Brandt’s lyrical and disorienting narrative mimics the fugue-like state of children leaving childhood, mapping anew a world they once felt at home in. —Suzanne Matson, author of The Tree-Sitter",101.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NjJZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NjJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=282&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Landscape’s Revenge,['Caio Yurgel'],"Landscape, as it appears and is described throughout the works of Bernardo Carvalho and Robert Walser, provides an excellent—yet virtually unexplored—pathway to the authors’ literary projects. The landscape functions here as a synthetic and unifying figure that triggers, at first, through the analysis of its description per se, the main and most evident elements of the authors’ works. However, when sustained as a methodological figure beyond the scope of its own description, the landscape soon reveals a darker, far more fascinating and far less explored side of the authors’ oeuvres: a vengeful, seemingly defeatist resentment against the status quo, which gives way to the more latent and biting elements of the authors’ prose, such as irony, the unheimlich, an anti-heroic agenda, the apocalyptic aesthetics of a disaster-prone fictional world, as well as an understanding of history and literature through the figures of failure and marginality. By drawing from diverse critical traditions from Latin-America and Europe, this comparative text seeks to unravel, in all of its complexity and scope, the fictional stage upon which Walser’s and Carvalho’s characters narrate, with their dying breath, a world that is slowly undoing itself.",264.0,['Foreign Language Study'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lwl2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Lwl2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=317&source=gbs_api,The ecology of failure in Robert Walser and Bernardo Carvalho,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lwl2DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Lwl2DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Literary Authority and the Modern Chinese Writer,['Wendy Larson'],"Throughout the twentieth century, Chinese writers have confronted the problem of creating a new literary tradition that both maintains the culturally unique aspects of a rich heritage and succeeds in promoting a new modernity. In the first book-length treatment of the topic, Wendy Larson examines the contradictory forms of authority at work in the autobiographical texts of modern Chinese writers and scholars and the way these conflicts helped to shape and determine the manner in which writers viewed themselves, their texts, and their work. Larson focuses on the most famous writers associated with the May Fourth Movement, a group most active in the 1920s and 1930s, and their fundamental ambivalence about writing. She analyzes how their writing paradoxically characterized textual labor as passive, negative, and inferior to material labor and the more physical political work of social progress, and she describes the ways they used textual means to devalue literary labor. The impact of China's increasing contact with the West--particularly the ways in which Western notions of ""individualism"" and ""democracy"" influenced Chinese ideologies of self and work--is considered. Larson also studies the changes in China's social structure, notably those linked to the abolition in 1905 of the educational exam system, which subsequently broke the link between the mastery of certain texts and the attainment of political power, further denigrating the cultural role of the writer.",234.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nT1kAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nT1kAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=325&source=gbs_api,Ambivalence and Autobiography,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nT1kAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-nT1kAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

They have been selected from a much larger number of miscellaneous papers, and are here brought together as having some unity of purpose, devoted as they are to the exposition and defence of doctrines which seem to me of priceless interest and importance. They were not meant to set forth novel opinions, or any mode of thought or system of belief here first propounded, but to guard and inculcate some of the old and familiar truths which are the best portion of the heritage which we have received from former generations. They express the earnest and persistent convictions of the writer upon topics of great moment, which still so far occupy the minds of all thoughtful persons as to appear foremost among what may be called the burning questions of the day.

Narrative Innovation and Incoherence,['Michael M. Boardman'],"When the impulse toward innovation arises late in a writer's career, it is often accompanied by a sense of urgency, and the result, as Narrative Innovation and Incoherence demonstrates, raises important questions for literary theory. Michael M. Boardman considers this pressing struggle to find a new form as it appears in the later works of Defoe, Goldsmith, Austen, Eliot, and Hemingway. He analyzes how these authors react to new and compelling beliefs for which a previous way of writing is no longer adequate. Urgent innovations, in this account, can only be understood as unique, individual responses to crises in belief. Taking as a point of departure French theorist Althusser's conviction that ideology is intelligible only through structure, Boardman searches for an explanation of both form and ideology not in Marxist concepts of base and superstructure but in the particular structure of an individual artist's writing career. Narrative ideology here becomes more complex than is generally assumed. Theoretically informed yet avoiding essentializing explanations of narrative invention, Narrative Innovation and Incoherence offers unexpected insights into the multifaceted relations between form and belief. It will encourage serious students of the novel to reexamine the importance of poetics as a mediating factor in the means of production.",248.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aYdlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aYdlAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Literary+Fiction&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=422&source=gbs_api,"Ideology in Defoe, Goldsmith, Austen, Eliot, and Hemingway",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aYdlAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-aYdlAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Sam said “Go right ahead, I'll just keep counting my money."" The farmer's piled into their trucks. Instead of going home like they told Sam they were, they had something else on their minds. One of the farmer's said, ""I don't know about you guys, but I think it's time we teach this egotistical money hungry farmer a lesson.""

Re-mapping World Literature,"['Gesine Müller', 'Jorge J. Locane', 'Benjamin Loy']","How can we talk about World Literature if we do not actually examine the world as a whole? Research on World Literature commonly focuses on the dynamics of a western center and a southern periphery, ignoring the fact that numerous literary relationships exist beyond these established constellations of thinking and reading within the Global South. Re-Mapping World Literature suggests a different approach that aims to investigate new navigational tools that extend beyond the known poles and meridians of current literary maps. Using the example of Latin American literatures, this study provides innovative insights into the literary modeling of shared historical experiences, epistemological crosscurrents, and book market processes within the Global South which thus far have received scant attention. The contributions to this volume, from renowned scholars in the fields of World and Latin American literatures, assess travelling aesthetics and genres, processes of translation and circulation of literary works, as well as the complex epistemological entanglements and shared worldviews between Latin America, Africa and Asia.

Literature in Exile,['Wheatland Foundation'],"In December 1987 a group of published novelists, poets, and journalists met in Vienna to participate in the Wheatland Conference on Literature. The writers presented papers addressing their common experience--that of being exiled. Each explored different facets of the condition of exile, providing answers to questions such as: What do exiled writers have in common? What is the exile's obligation to colleagues and readers in the country of origin? Is the effect of changing languages one of enrichment or impoverishment? How does the new society treat the emigre? Following each essay is a peer discussion of the topic addressed. The volume includes writers whose origins lie in Central Europe, South Africa, Israel, Cuba, Chile, Somalia, and Turkey. Through their testimony of the creative process in exile, we gain insight into the forces which affect the creative process as a whole. Contributors.

"Stand Fast, Craig-Royston!",['William Black'],"Old Mr. Bethune imagines himself the descendant of an ancient Scotch family, whose motto for centuries has been ""Stand Fast, Craig-Royston."" He is engaged in getting up a work on Scotch ballad poetry, and imagines he has squandered a fortune. He feels the world owes him a living, and, greatly to his grand-daughter Maisie's mortification, he accepts favors from all sides. The plot enables Black to introduce quotations from Scotch literature with artistic effect. The romantic interest is slight but tender and pretty.

How Is World Literature Made?,['Gesine Müller'],"The debate over the concept of world literature, which has been taking place with renewed intensity over the last twenty years, is tightly bound up with the issues of global interconnectedness in a polycentric world. Most recently, critiques of globalization-related conceptualizations, in particular, have made themselves heard: to what extent is the concept of world literature too closely connected with the political and economic dynamics of globalization? Such questions cannot be answered simply through theoretical debate. The material side of the production of world literature must therefore be more strongly integrated into the conversation than it has been. Using the example of Latin American literatures, this volume demonstrates the concrete construction processes of world literature. To that purpose, archival materials have been analyzed here: notes, travel reports, and correspondence between publishers and authors. The Latin American examples provide particularly rich information about the processes of institutionalization in the Western world, as well as new perspectives for a contemporary mapping of world literature beyond the established dynamics of canonization.",182.0,['Foreign Language Study'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQ5QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gQ5QEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT148&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,The Global Circulations of Latin American Literatures,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"Knowledge, Spirit, Law: Book 2: The Anti-capitalist Sublime",['Gavin Keeney'],"Knowledge, Spirit, Law, Book 2: The Anti-capitalist Sublime takes up where Knowledge, Spirit, Law, Book 1: Radical Scholarship (2015) left off, foremost in terms of a critique of neo-liberal academia and its demotion of the book in favor of various mediatic practices that substitute, arguably, for the one form of critical inquiry that might safeguard speculative intellectual inquiry as long-form and long-term project, especially in relationship to the archive or library (otherwise known as the ""public domain""). This ongoing critique of neo-liberal academia is a necessary corrective to processes underway today toward the further marginalization of radical critique, with many of the traditional forms of sustained analysis being replaced by pseudo-empirical studies that abandon themes only presentable in the Arts and Humanities through the ""arcanian closure"" that the book as long-form inquisition represents (whether as novel, non-fictional critique, or something in-between). As a tomb for thought, this privileging of the shadowy recesses of the book preserves, through the very apparatuses of long- and slow-form scholarship, the premises presented here as indicative of an anti-capitalist project embedded in works that might otherwise shun such a characterization. The perverse capitalist capture of knowledge through mass digitalization is - paradoxically - the negative corollary for the reduction by abstraction of everyday works to a philosophical and moral inquest against Capital. The latter actually constitutes a transversal reduction for works (across works) toward the age-old antithesis to instrumentalized socio-cultural production - Spirit. For similar reasons, the anti-capitalist sublime as presented here is primarily a product of the imaginative, magical-realist regimes of thought in service to ""no capital"" - to no capitalization of thought. This book seeks to re-establish paradigmatic, a-historical, and universalizing practices in humanistic scholarship associated with speculative inquiry as a form of art, utilizing in passing forms of art and exemplary paradigmatic practices that are also first-order forms of speculative inquiry - suggesting that first-order works in the Arts and Humanities are those works that may ""suffer"" second-order incorporations without the attendant loss of the impress of sublimity (Spirit).",272.0,['Performing Arts'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Em6oEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Em6oEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA131&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=19&source=gbs_api,,No link available
"World Literature, Cosmopolitanism, Globality","['Gesine Müller', 'Mariano Siskind']","From today’s vantage point it can be denied that the confidence in the abilities of globalism, mobility, and cosmopolitanism to illuminate cultural signification processes of our time has been severely shaken. In the face of this crisis, a key concept of this globalizing optimism as World Literature has been for the past twenty years necessarily is in the need of a comprehensive revision. World Literature, Cosmopolitanism, Globality: Beyond, Against, Post, Otherwise offers a wide range of contributions approaching the blind spots of the globally oriented Humanities for phenomena that in one way or another have gone beyond the discourses, aesthetics, and political positions of liberal cosmopolitanism and neoliberal globalization. Departing basically (but not exclusively) from different examples of Latin American literatures and cultures in globalized contexts, this volume provides innovative insights into critical readings of World Literature and its related conceptualizations. A timely book that embraces highly innovative perspectives, it will be a mustread for all scholars involved in the field of the global dimensions of literature.",246.0,['Foreign Language Study'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S_UEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=S_UEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT30&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=20&source=gbs_api,"Beyond, Against, Post, Otherwise",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S_UEEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-S_UEEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Architecture and the Novel Under the Italian Fascist Regime,"['Francesca Billiani', 'Laura Pennacchietti']","This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license ""Francesca Billiani and Laura Pennacchietti draw brilliantly and with precision the evolution of the new architecture and of the national novel (with insights on translations of international novels), whose profiles had been shaped from different angles, especially in the 1930s. These two fields, apparently so distant one from the other, had never been analysed in parallel. This book does this and uncovers several points of contact between the two, spanning propaganda and theoretical turning points."" —Chiara Costa and Cornelia Mattiacci, Fondazione Prada, Italy ""This book shows convincingly how the arte di Stato during Fascism was created with the morality of a new novel as well as architecture. It is surprising to read how one of the representatives of State art, Giuseppe Bottai, is also one of the finest critics of realist novels and rationalist architecture. More than parallel endeavours, the system of the arts during the Fascist regime should be viewed as a series of intersections of cultural, political and aesthetic discourses."" —Monica Jansen, Utrecht University, The Netherlands Architecture and the Novel under the Italian Fascist Regime discusses the relationship between the novel and architecture during the Fascist period in Italy (1922-1943). By looking at two profoundly diverse aesthetic phenomena within the context of the creation of a Fascist State art, Billiani and Pennacchietti argue that an effort of construction, or reconstruction, was the main driving force behind both projects: the advocated ""revolution"" of the novel form (realism) and that of architecture (rationalism). The book is divided into seven chapters, which in turn analyze the interconnections between the novel and architecture in theory and in practice. The first six chapters cover debates on State art, on the novel and on architecture, as well as their historical development and their unfolding in key journals of the per iod. The last chapter offers a detailed analysis of some important novels and buildings, which have in practice realized some of the key principles articulated in the theoretical disputes.

The contributions of the conference address three fields of computer game research that are philosophically relevant and, likewise, to which philosophical reflection is crucial. These are: ethics and politics, the action-space of games, and the magic circle. All three topics are interlinked and constitute the paradigmatic object of computer games: Whereas the first describes computer games on the outside, looking at the cultural effects of games as well as on moral practices acted out with them, the second describes computer games on the inside, i.e. how they are constituted as a medium.

Finding Room in Beirut,['Carole Lévesque'],"Finding Room in Beirut: Places of the Everyday demonstrates why it is worth our while to explore the value and contemporary meaning of urban areas about to undergo complete renewal. Branching off from discourses surrounding the terrain vague, the book argues that large populated urban areas meet the criteria of the vague and constitute a particular perspective from which to build a critical stance in regards to the contemporary city. But unlike a terrain vague, a vague urbain -- inhabited areas where property ownership is usually obscure and informal behaviours a daily affair -- possesses real communities and offers an alternative understanding on how a city can be practiced and how lessons should be learned before its complete transformation. Stemming from a photographic and architectural documentation of Bachoura, a central area of Beirut, Lebanon, the book shows how the vague urbain allows for different ways of inhabiting, ways that are as -- or perhaps even more -- real and anchored in the imagination of the city as those proposed by standardising developments. Building on the intricacies of found situations, improvised uses and local narratives, it is an exploration as to how the meeting of a marvellous realism with l'intrigue, the vague urbain, and temporary architecture can provide opportunities for the emergence of hidden narratives.",144.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kASVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kASVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA82&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=26&source=gbs_api,Places of the Everyday,No link available

"Long History, Deep Time","['Ann McGrath', 'Mary Anne Jebb']","The vast shape-shifting continent of Australia enables us to take a long view of history. We consider ways to cross the great divide between the deep past and the present. Australia’s human past is not a short past, so we need to enlarge the scale and scope of history beyond 1788. In ways not so distant, these deeper times happened in the same places where we walk today. Yet, they were not the same places, having different surfaces, ecologies and peoples. Contributors to this volume show how the earth and its past peoples can wake us up to a sense of place as history – as a site of both change and continuity. This book ignites the possibilities of what the spaces and expanses of history might be. Its authors reflect upon the need for appropriate, feasible timescales for history, pointing out some of the obstacles encountered in earlier efforts to slice human time into thematic categories. Time and history are considered from the perspective of physics, archaeology, literature, western and Indigenous philosophy. Ultimately, this collection argues for imaginative new approaches to collaborative histories of deep time that are better suited to the challenges of the Anthropocene. Contributors to this volume, including many leading figures in their respective disciplines, consider history’s temporality, and ask how history might expand to accommodate a chronology of deep time. Long histories that incorporate humanities, science and Indigenous knowledge may produce deeper meanings of the worlds in which we live.",279.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nDSCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6nDSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=30&source=gbs_api,Deepening Histories of Place,No link available

The Ninth Pawn of White,['Vijay Fafat'],"The ninth pawn lives on the edge of reality, a mischief of the subconscious. It is a missed opportunity conflated into a regret of unfulfilled life, a minor joy which blossoms into ecstasy, a drop of thought which can unfurl a paradigm, a tiny desire which becomes unquenchable thirst of quest, an irrelevant misunderstanding which becomes a running feud of distress and argument with the world…. The ninth pawn sits at the back of our minds, frequently expressing itself in our actions without our knowledge, not waiting for us to hear it, but always pulsating with the potential to bring us in touch with magic and meaning of life. Herein dwells the wonder and promise of the mind. The short verses here are an invitation to the reader to paint the nuances of this non-existent ninth pawn which governs our lives as the invisible hand. They are simple drops of incipient thought; incomplete emotions looking for their outlets. By themselves, they are of limited consequence, like the ninth pawn, and left to their devices, they might well merge back, un-composed, in the infinite book of unwritten verses. Their flight cannot materialize without the reader's indulgence, and her own interpretations in metaphor of the inspired thought.

Alison and Peter Smithson,"['Alison Margaret Smithson', 'Peter Smithson', 'Beatriz Colomina', 'Design Museum (London, England)']","Striving to adapt the progressive ideas of the pre-war modern movement to the specific human needs of post-war reconstruction, Alison and Peter Smithson were among the most influential and controversial architects of the latter half of the twentieth century. As younger members of CIAM (Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) and as founding members of Team 10 they were at the heart of the debate on the future course of Modern Architecture. Their polemics and designs - addressing issues such as the rising consumer society and the orientation of urban planning - laid the foundations for New Brutalism and the Pop Art Movement of the 1960s. An important adaptation made by the Smithsons and their generation was the rejection of modernism's machine aesthetics. The new notions of place and territory were juxtaposed to Le Corbusier's machine à habiter. To the Smithsons a house was a particular place, which should be suited to its location and able to meet the ordinary requirements of everyday life and to accommodate its inhabitants' individual patterns of use. This exhibition examines the evolution of the Smithsons' approach to this everyday ""art of inhabitation."" It does this by extensively documenting most of their designs for individual dwellings, especially their optimistic House of the Future of 1956 and the series of renovations of and additions to the fairy-tale-like Hexenhaus in Germany from the late 1980s onward",276.0,['Architects'],3.5,4.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PbT8SWIOHNgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PbT8SWIOHNgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Magical+Realism&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=176&source=gbs_api,From the House of the Future to a House of Today,No link available

In this collection of essays, Australian scholars discuss the crime of genocide, examining regimes and episodes that stretch across time and geography. Included are discussions on Australia’s own history of genocide against its Indigenous peoples, mass killing and human rights abuses in Indonesia and North Korea, and new insights into some of the core twentieth century genocides, such as the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide. Scholars grapple with ongoing questions of memory and justice, governmental responsibility, the role of the medical professions, gendered experiences, artistic representation, and best practice in genocide education. Importantly, genocide prevention and the role of the global community is also explored within this collection.

Art and Aesthetics of Modern Mythopoeia V2,['Ritushree Sengupta & Ashish Kumar Gupta'],"Human culture has always weaved myths around its pattern of existence for multiple purposes. The interplay of religion and social practices have found their own space within the sphere of mythology. It is possible to read mythical texts to probe into the greater picture of human civilization. The contribution of myths towards the shaping of human beliefs, behavioural patterns are evident and assessing them often reveals a plethora of cultural histories unexplored and therefore unacknowledged before. The contribution of mythopoeia towards the construct of human socio-cultural identity has been largely accepted. Modern academia has thus taken a strong interest in revisionist literature to understand the hitherto unknown nuances of human civilization. In the edited anthology, Art and Aesthetics of Modern Mythopoeia: Literatures, Myths and Revisionism (Vol-II), like the first volume, an attempt has been made to anthologize the works of a large number of authors who have talked about pertinent issues in the context of myth-making, the latent politics of mythopoeia and has taken into account several under-explored texts that are rich in mythical content.

Slavers rode in on monstrous ships. They took everyone, including me. I was taken to a horrible black city called Nuerva, where the buildings were jagged lines cutting across the sky. A man, the Captain, took me as his plaything and kept me as his own prisoner. After many days, I finally found the courage to escape. Alone and frightened, I ran to the furthest edge of the city, and there I found hope. There was another city in the distance—a bright, colorful one. All I had to do was cross the bridge.

Framing Education,['Lars Wallner'],"Interest in comics as Swedish school material has risen in the last few years and the publication of comics for children and adolescents has also increased. Meanwhile, although research around new literacies has taken an interest in combinations of image and text, there is still little research on comics as a literacy material, especially as part of school practices. With comics’ rise in popularity, and their quality as examples of new literacies, this points to the relevance of exploring how meaning making with comics is done in schools. The purpose of this study is to contribute knowledge on how locally situated literacy practices are done, practices in which pupils and teachers make meaning with comics. The study combines literacy, comics and discursive psychology to investigate aspects of literacy not as individual, inner workings, but as part of participants’ social constructions, in line with New Literacy Studies. With this perspective, it is possible to investigate literary concepts such as narrative, and participants’ construction of story elements, through the way in which these aspects are utilized by participants to construct social action – what participants do with their utterances. To study this, video recordings have been made in one primary and one secondary school, in two different Swedish cities. The results of the study show constructions of a comics literacy, where participants engage with both visual and textual aspects of the material and negotiate focalization of narrative perspective and construction of narrative structure as well as narrative devices such as speech and thought bubbles. Furthermore, meaning making of comics literacy also includes the construction of discourses around comics as a specific type of story telling, either for material or literary reasons. The thesis discusses how participants construct classroom literature, and provides insight into how interaction around comics enables participants to construct and negotiate discourses around what comics literacy is and what it enables, as well as how to talk about, create, and read comics. Intresset för serier som svenskt skolmaterial har stigit de senaste åren och publiceringen av serier för barn och ungdomar har också ökat. Även om forskning om new literacies har intresserat sig för kombinationer av bild och text så finns det fortfarande lite forskning på serier som literacymaterial, speciellt som en del av skolpraktik. Med det stigande intresset för serier och deras kvaliteter som exempel på new literacies, så pekar detta mot att det finns en relevans i att utforska hur meningsskapande med serier görs i skolan. Syftet med denna studie är att bidra med kunskap om hur lokalt situerad literacypraktik görs där elever och lärare skapar mening med serier. Studien kombinerar forskning om literacy, serier och diskursiv psykologi för att, i linje med New Literacy Studies, undersöka aspekter av literacy som en del av deltagarnas sociala konstruktioner – inte som ett individuellt, mentalt fenomen. Med detta perspektiv är det möjligt att undersöka litterära koncept som narrativ och deltagares konstruktion av berättelseinslag, genom det sätt på vilka dessa aspekter används av deltagare för att interagera – vad deltagare gör när de säger något. För att studera detta har videoobservationer använts i en lågstadieskola och en högstadieskola i två olika svenska städer. Resultaten från studien demonstrerar konstruktioner av serie-literacy där deltagarna engagerar sig i både text och bild i materialet, diskuterar berättandeperspektiv och konstruktioner av narrativ struktur, såväl som berättarverktyg, t.ex. prat- och tankebubblor. Därutöver inkluderar serie-literacy också deltagarnas skapande av seriediskurser där serier görs till en specifik typ av berättande, antingen på materiell eller litterär basis. Avhandlingen diskuterar hur deltagare konstruerar klassrumslitteratur, och studien erbjuder en insikt i hur interaktion runt serier möjliggör för deltagare att konstruera och förhandla diskurser om vad serieliteracy är och vad det erbjuder för möjligheter, såväl som hur deltagare kan prata om, skapa och läsa serier.",151.0,"['Comic books, strips, etc., in education']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2po7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2po7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA58&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=37&source=gbs_api,Doing Comics Literacy in the Classroom,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2po7DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2po7DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Hip-Hop, Art, and Visual Culture","['Jeffrey L. Broome', 'Lisa Munson']","Visual art has been tied to hip-hop culture since its emergence in the 1970s. Commentary on these initial connections often emphasizes the importance of graffiti and fashion during hip-hop’s earliest days. Forty years later, hip-hop music has grown into a billion-dollar global industry, and its influence on visual art and society has also expanded. This book-length printed edition of Arts collects essays by scholars who explore this evolving influence through their work in art education, cultural theory, and visual culture studies. The topics covered by these authors include discussions on identity and cultural appropriation, equity and access as represented in select works of art, creativity and copyright in digital media, and the use of fine art tropes within the sociocultural history of hip-hop. As a collected volume, these essays make potentially important contributions to broadening the narrative on art education and hip-hop beyond the topics of graffiti, fashion, and the use of cyphers in educational contexts.",80.0,['Art'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LZPaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LZPaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=39&source=gbs_api,"Connections, Influences, and Critical Discussions",No link available

Women and Fairness,"['Eva Lambertsson Björk', 'Jutta Eschenbach', 'Johanna M.

The collection explores narratives of women – real and fictional – who fight against these barriers, who succumb to them, who remain unaware of them, or choose to ignore them. It explores the ways we read women in cultural production, and how women are read in society. We assert the obstacles constructed into the very fabric of societies against fifty percent of the population are unfair, be they hindrances for women to attain their goals, encumbrances that limit women’s speech and societal participation – communal and artistic – or hindrances that prohibit specific behaviors and images of women.",196.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOxUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tOxUEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=47&source=gbs_api,Navigating an Unfair World,No link available

The Politics of Dementia,"['Irmela Marei Krüger-Fürhoff', 'Nina Schmidt', 'Sue Vice']","Memory loss is not always viewed purely as a contingent neurobiological process present in an ageing population; rather, it is frequently related to larger societal issues and political debates. This edited volume examines how different media and genres – novels, auto/biographical writings, documentary as well as fictional films and graphic memoirs – represent dementia for the sake of critical explorations of memory, trauma and contested truths. In ten analytical chapters and one piece of graphic art, the contributors examine the ways in which what might seem to be the individual, ahistorical diseases of dementia are used in contemporary cultural texts to represent and respond to violent historical and political events – ranging from the Holocaust to postcolonial conditions – all of which can prove difficult to remember. Combining approaches from literary studies with insights from memory studies, trauma studies, anthropology, the critical medical humanities and media, film and comics studies, this volume explores the politics of dementia and incites new debates on cultures of remembrance, while remaining attentive to the lived reality of dementia.",234.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YQ5QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YQ5QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=200&source=gbs_api,"Forgetting and Remembering the Violent Past in Literature, Film and Graphic Narratives",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YQ5QEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Freaks Like Me,['Omri Koresh'],"In his exhibition Freaks like me at the Orly Dvir Gallery, Omri Koresh, a young Israeli promising artist, who describes himself as ""somewhere between femininity and masculinity” portrays renewed reading of known Israeli and international figures, such as Orit Fux, Nona Chalant, olga leonidov, Topaz Arbell and Alina Kireyev. The images raise the question whether allowing oneself to transgress traditional forms of femininity and masculinity is a liberating process or a binding one; does the ability to shape one’s appearance in the real world, or through art reinforces or undermines the spontaneous and free spirit of human existence? In Koresh’s artistic world, the deviation from the familiar structures is not portrayed as a source of freedom and human expression. Instead, his characters appear tied to meticulous aesthetic norms, in an attempt to please unknown observing gazes. The carefully constructed figures convey the message that transgender characteristics or extreme sexuality reinstates the displayed body as a subject to rigid criteria of thinness and beauty. The request for freedom through the ability to shape one’s sexual identity and bypass the rigid boundaries of sexual constructions is not met.

The Admiral,['Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen'],"SOME years ago, Professor J. K. Laughton's admirable selection of “Letters and Dispatches of Horatio, Viscount Nelson,” inspired me with such an interest in Nelson's wonderfully human and graphic correspondence that I studied the larger and earlier “Dispatches and Letters of Lord Nelson,” collected by Sir Harris Nicolas. The present book is the outcome of a long and affectionate study of these two works, and the well-thumbed pages of Southey and Jeaffreson.But since, at the time of my first visit to Sicily, a little more than two years ago, I had definitely before me the project of writing a Nelson novel for the one-hundredth anniversary of the Battle of the Nile (August 1st, 1898), I have read most of the important works dealing with Lord Nelson's life, especially Captain Mahan's “Life of Nelson,” which is a monument of impartiality, research, and the application of professional knowledge to literature. I have also, by the kindness of Lord Dundonald, Mr. Morrison, and others, had the opportunity of seeing a quantity of unpublished Nelsoniana, which have been of the utmost value to me in forming a final opinion of the character of my hero.",440.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2WY1AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2WY1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=211&source=gbs_api,A Romance of Nelson in the Year of the Nile,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2WY1AAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-2WY1AAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"Optical Document Security: Measurement, Characterization and Visualization",['Mikael Lindstrand'],"Documents of high value, such as passports, tickets and banknotes, facilitate means for authentication. Authentication processes aim at mitigating counterfeit “passable products”. The arsenal of “security features” in the business is abundant but an effective and reliable counterfeit mitigating system need an architectural approach rather than either relying on one feature only, or vaguely motivated aggregated security features. Optically variable device (OVD) is a concept in the industry, including costefficient and unique authentication functionality. OVD based features may serve as the main counterfeit mitigating functionality, as in banknotes. For higher value documents, such as passports, security architectural design may include multimodal (combined) features in which OVD is one characterizing and necessary aspect. Thereby a successful counterfeit need not only to simulate (“hack”) electronic based security features, such as radio frequency based identifier combined with public key infrastructure based cryptography (PKI) but also simulate OVD functionality. Combined feature authentication, based e.g. on PKI and OVD that relies on principally different physics and hence technology competences is of especial interest. Well-architectured and implemented, such multimodal counterfeit mitigating systems are effective to the degree that producing passable products requiring more resources than potentially illegitimately gained by the counterfeiter. Irrespective of level of ambition and efforts spent on counterfeit mitigation, OVD remains critically important as a security concept. One feature of OVD is the possibility to include a human inspector in the authentication procedure. Including such “man-in-the-loop” reduces the risk of successful and unnoticed simulations of algorithms, such as PKI. One challenge of OVD is a lack of standards or even measurements characterizing the significant aspects influencing a human based inspection. This thesis introduces a system able to measure, characterize and visualize the significant aspects influencing a human based inspection of OVD features. The contribution includes the development of a multidimensional and high-dynamic range (HDR) color measurement system of spatial and angular resolution. The capturing of HDR images is particularly demanding for certain high contrast OVD features and require innovative algorithms to achieve the necessary high contrast sensitivity function of the imaging sensor. Representing the significant aspects influencing a human based inspection of OVD requires a considerable amount of data. The development of an appropriate information protocol is therefore of importance, to facilitate further analysis, data processing and visualization. The information protocol transforming the measurement data into characterizing information is a second significant achievement of the presented work in this thesis. To prove the applicability measurements, visualizations and statistically based analyses have been developed for a selection of previously unsolved problems, as defined by senior scientists and representatives of central banks. Characterization and measurements of the degree to which OVD deteriorate with circulation is one such problem. One particular benefit of the implemented suggested solution is the characterization and measurement aim at aspects influencing human based (“first line”) inspection. The principally difference in the problems treated indicates the generality of the system, which is a third significant project achievement. The system developed achieves the accuracy and precision including a resolution, dynamic range and contrast sensitivity function required for a technology independent standard protocol of “optical document security” OVDs. These abilities facilitate the definition and verification of program of requirements for the development of new security documents. Adding also the capability of interlinking first, second and third line inspection based characterizations may prove a particular valuable combination, which is a fourth significant project achievement. The information content (Entropy) of characterized OVDs and OVD production limitations in combination opens for OVD based novel applications of “physically unclonable functions” (PUF). This is of significance as it would generalize the established OVDs to facilitate multimodal verification, including PUF verification. The OVDs would thereby transform into a combined PUF first line inspection facilitating security feature.",81.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YvpwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YvpwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=217&source=gbs_api,in the Light of Visual Evaluation,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YvpwDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YvpwDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Takers Economy : An Inquiry into Illegal File Sharing,['Christopher Stewart'],"Over the last decade or so, file sharing has become a widespread phenomenon. As much as having the possibility of exchanging information almost instantaneously can represent a blessing in terms of communication and progress, it obviously opens the door to pursuits that enjoy a far less angelic reputation. Still, the overall picture suggests that a significant number of internet users participate in such ill-famed activities. Considering this state of affairs, could illegal file sharing actually be a positive process for those downloaders, and for the collectivity alike ? The question is generally approached from the angle of its economic impacts, but there is evidently more to the issue than its pecuniary dimension. Takers Economy proposes an alternative look at illegal file sharing in light of the role of art in society, and in the context of the oneness of all beings and things. In addition, the inquiry explores the global picture from which the circumstances emerge, and attempts to characterize the underlying culture that gives rise to them. Finally, the essay introduces a philosophy of endosymbiotism that aims to foster attitudes and behaviours that accord with the ethics of the inherent unseparateness of being.",114.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FNmzTc_sR9sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FNmzTc_sR9sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Graphic+Novel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=250&source=gbs_api,,No link available

"The Classic Short Story, 1870-1925",['Florence Goyet'],"The ability to construct a nuanced narrative or complex character in the constrained form of the short story has sometimes been seen as the ultimate test of an author's creativity. Yet during the time when the short story was at its most popular - the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - even the greatest writers followed strict generic conventions that were far from subtle. This expanded and updated translation of Florence Goyet's influential La Nouvelle, 1870-1925: Description d'un genre à son apogée (Paris, 1993) is the only study to focus exclusively on this classic period across different continents. Ranging through French, English, Italian, Russian and Japanese writing - particularly the stories of Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Giovanni Verga, Anton Chekhov and Akutagawa Ry?nosuke - Goyet shows that these authors were able to create brilliant and successful short stories using the very simple 'tools of brevity' of that period. In this challenging and far-reaching study, Goyet looks at classic short stories in the context in which they were read at the time: cheap newspapers and higher-end periodicals. She demonstrates that, despite the apparent intention of these stories to question bourgeois ideals, they mostly affirmed the prejudices of their readers. In doing so, her book forces us to re-think our preconceptions about this 'forgotten' genre.",220.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GFW8AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GFW8AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=7&source=gbs_api,Theory of a Genre,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFW8AgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-GFW8AgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

""A Woman of Properties"" is a satirical suburban tale (reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor or Cheever) about a real estate agent with a grudge. ""The Girl at the Window"" is an unsettling and mysterious tale about our relationship to the past. Also included is an extended interview the author gave about the craft of writing in 2009. During his career as a writer, Mr. Matthews was distinguished professor of Fiction Writing at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio for over 4 decades. Winner of Guggenheim and several arts grants, Matthews has been anthologized widely, translated into several languages and nominated for a National Book Award.

(Tom O'Brien, New York Times) ""Matthews' always graceful prose finds that precise telling detail. It's easy to fall in love with such writing."" (Perry Glasser, North American Review) ""Engaging wit and irony have been characteristic of Matthews's writing from the start, and both are strongly present in his latest gatherings of stories. His irony is increasingly darker, however, and his characters' obsession with memory and its distortions plays a more dominant role in this later work, much of which deals with death. For the most part, these are stories with deceptively simple and ordinary surfaces, but they are driven by powerful and ominous undercurrents, which often fuse the local and regional with the archetypal.

Flight Path & Other Stories,['Jan Bowman'],"The stories in Flight Path & Other Stories reveal the power of kindness. In difficult moments of human contact, explored from childhood through old age, this collection provides a window into the kindness all people seek in moments of sorrow. In her poem Kindness, Naomi Shihab Nye writes that when you know sorrow as “the other deepest thing . . . then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore.” from - “Kindness” in Words Under The Words: Selected Poems (1995) by Naomi Shihab Nye. The dynamic mix of characters in these stories, know much about sorrow. They know it in the burden of a wife looking after her war-damaged husband and the son who confronts her more than 35 years after she abandons them. They know it in the struggle to hide from violence of the world, even though violence finds them. But they do know kindness, too. They know it in the unspoken understanding between a young man and his elderly aunt in the aftermath of a violent murder. They know it in small gestures between friends, and even strangers, after a sudden death, as well as through the unexpected connections found on the other end of the phone or a shared meal.",109.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WzJZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=WzJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=127&source=gbs_api,,No link available

"Summer on the Lakes, in 1843",['Margaret Fuller'],"Sarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli (1810-1850), better known as Margaret Fuller, was a writer, editor, translator, early feminist thinker, critic, and social reformer who was associated with the Transcendentalist movement in New England. This is her introspective account of a trip to the Great Lakes region in 1843. Organized as a series of travel episodes interspersed with literary and social commentary, the work displays a style common to the portfolios, sketch books, and commonplace books kept by educated nineteenth-century women. In addition to her own thoughts about natural landscapes and human encounters, Fuller includes stories, legends, allegorical dialogues, poems, and excerpts from the works of other authors. When she traveled to the Midwest, Fuller was exhausted by her work as editor of the Dial, the Transcendentalist journal she edited with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Accompanied during part of the journey by her friends James Clarke and Sarah Clarke, who created the book's etchings, Fuller traveled by train, steamboat, carriage, and on foot in a circle from Niagara Falls north to Mackinac Island and Sault Ste. Marie, west to Milwaukee, south to Pawpaw, Illinois, and back to Buffalo. Fuller discusses Chicago in some detail, and laments the unjust treatment of Native Americans. She comments on the difficulties of pioneer life for women and on the degradation of the region's beautiful and exhilarating natural environment. She speaks favorably about the British-American agrarian visionary, Morris Birbeck, and includes a short story about an old school friend, Mariana, who dies because her active mind cannot adapt to the restrictive codes of behavior prescribed for the era's elite women.",288.0,['Great Lakes'],3.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EpJLAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EpJLAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=148&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EpJLAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-EpJLAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity.,['Jan M. Ziolkowski'],"This ambitious and vivid study in six volumes explores the journey of a single, electrifying story, from its first incarnation in a medieval French poem through its prolific rebirth in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Juggler of Notre Dame tells how an entertainer abandons the world to join a monastery, but is suspected of blasphemy after dancing his devotion before a statue of the Madonna in the crypt; he is saved when the statue, delighted by his skill, miraculously comes to life. Jan Ziolkowski tracks the poem from its medieval roots to its rediscovery in late nineteenth-century Paris, before its translation into English in Britain and the United States. The visual influence of the tale on Gothic revivalism and vice versa in America is carefully documented with lavish and inventive illustrations, and Ziolkowski concludes with an examination of the explosion of interest in The Juggler of Notre Dame in the twentieth century and its place in mass culture today. Volume 2: Medieval Meets Medievalism deals with the influence of the tale in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe and America, and the development of literary medievalism at this time. The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity is a rich case study for the reception of the Middle Ages in modernity. Spanning centuries and continents, the medieval period is understood through the lens of its (post)modern reception in Europe and America. Profound connections between the verbal and the visual are illustrated by a rich trove of images, including book illustrations, stained glass, postage stamps, architecture, and Christmas cards. Presented with great clarity and simplicity, Ziolkowski's work is accessible to the general reader, while its many new discoveries will be valuable to academics in such fields and disciplines as medieval studies, medievalism, philology, literary history, art history, folklore, performance studies, and reception studies.",354.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RBFrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RBFrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1985&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=149&source=gbs_api,Volume 2: Medieval Meets Medievalism,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RBFrDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RBFrDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

If you back talked the Marshall he would shoot you in both legs, then drag your wounded body with a rope he held as he rode his horse up to the Gallows to be hung high and when the Marshall was through watching the dead body swing back and forth on the Gallows he would set their body on fire and light his cigar from the flames off their body.

Kellie's Diary #1,"['Thomas Jenner', 'Angeline Jenner']","A series of diary entries through the eyes of a little girl as she tries to survive the end of the world. ""Surrealistic and haunting, this story gets under the skin like a virulent infection... Jenner's slightly twisted yet subtle narrative as seen through Kellie's innocent eyes is compelling..."" - George Wier, Mystery Author This is the first book of the Kellie's Diary series, and it is entirely from the viewpoint of a little girl writing to her diary. You meet Kellie, a bright and inquisitive 9-year-old living the typical suburban life with her family. She goes to school, complains about lunch, and thinks boys are gross. She also writes daily entries into her diary, whom she calls ""Barbie.""

Demonstratives in discourse,"['Åshild Næss', 'Anna Margetts ', 'Yvonne Treis']","This volume explores the use of demonstratives in the structuring and management of discourse, and their role as engagement expressions, from a crosslinguistic perspective. It seeks to establish which types of discourse-related functions are commonly encoded by demonstratives, beyond the well-established reference-tracking and deictic uses, and also investigates which members of demonstrative paradigms typically take on certain functions. Moreover, it looks at the roles of non-deictic demonstratives, that is, members of the paradigm which are dedicated e.g. to contrastive, recognitional, or anaphoric functions and do not express deictic distinctions. Several of the studies also focus on manner demonstratives, which have been little studied from a crosslinguistic perspective. The volume thus broadens the scope of investigation of demonstratives to look at how their core functions interact with a wider range of discourse functions in a number of different languages. The volume covers languages from a range of geographical locations and language families, including Cushitic and Mande languages in Africa, Oceanic and Papuan languages in the Pacific region, Algonquian and Guaykuruan in the Americas, and Germanic, Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages in the Eurasian region. It also includes two papers taking a broader typological approach to specific discourse functions of demonstratives.",360.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HG4WEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HG4WEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA224&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=245&source=gbs_api,,No link available
"The £1,000,000 Bank-note",['Mark Twain'],"""I was a twenty-seven-year-old mining-broker's clerk in San Francisco, and an expert in all the details of stock traffic. I was alone in the world and had nothing to depend upon but my wits and a clean reputation; but these were setting my feet in the road to eventual fortune, and I was content with the prospect."" -The £1,000,000 Bank Note (1893) The £1,000,000 Bank Note and Other New Stories (1893) is a collection of nine humorous short stories by Mark Twain.

The Crows of Deliverance,['Nirmal Verma'],"NIRMAL VERMA (1929-2005) was an acknowledged master of Hindi prose and one of the pioneers of the Nai Kahani (new story) movement in Hindi. Throughout his life he was known as a major voice among the Indian intelligentsia for consistently upholding the right of individual liberty and freedom of expression. He famously took a stand against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Emergency (1975-77), and he also advocated the cause of a Free Tibet. He traveled widely in Europe and the USA including many years in Prague, leaving after the Soviet invasion. With his fiction and also reportage for The Times of India, he earned the title ""an Indian writer exiled in Europe."" Readers International published the first collection of his stories available in English outside India: The World Elsewhere and Other Stories (1988), winner of the Sahitya Akademi award. He also won the Jnanpith's Murtidevi Award for his essays, and in 1999 he received the highest literary award of India, the Bharatiya Jnanpith Award for the totality of his works, stories, novels, essays, travelogues, and translations. The Crows of Deliverance (1991), his second collection translated into English from Readers International, touches on what he felt were key themes in his stories (from a 2002 interview): ""My works essentially deal with situations arising out of troubled relationships among the members of the same family or strained man-woman ties. Indians are very accustomed to the joint family system with strong ties of kinship. But in the last 30-40 years, increasing industrialisation and massive migration of people has taken its toll on the system. With the evolution of the nuclear family. Everyone now has to lead his own life. The disintegration of the joint family has snatched the feeling of security from individuals who now have to bear the strains and tensions alone. ""The second most important development is the emergence of an independent woman -- a woman not dependent on others but a person who has the capacity to stand on her own feet. In the past, the Indian woman has been a victim of many malpractices and injustices that were operating in our family system. The emergence of the 'new' woman has created a sort of a revolution in the network of human relationships in society and also led to peculiar tensions. These important developments in the Indian family system and society have created situations in relationships that have become central themes of my fiction.""",200.0,['Fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l0ZRAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l0ZRAQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=265&source=gbs_api,Stories,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l0ZRAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-l0ZRAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Vibrant Architecture,['Rachel Armstrong'],"This book sets out the conditions under which the need for a new approach to the production of architecture in the twenty-first century is established, where our homes and cities are facing increasing pressures from environmental challenges that are compromising our lives and well being. Vibrant architecture embodies a new kind of architectural design practice that explores how lively materials, or 'vibrant matter', may be incorporated into our buildings to confer on them some of the properties of living things, such as movement, growth, sensitivity and self-repair. The theoretical and practical implications of how this may occur are explored through the application of a new group of materials. Characteristically, these substances possess some of the properties of living systems but may not have the full status of being truly alive. They include forms of chemical artificial life such as 'dynamic droplets' or synthetically produced soils. As complex systems, they are able to communicate directly with the natural world using a shared language of chemistry and so, negotiate their continued survival in a restless world. Vibrant architecture may create new opportunities for architectural design practice that venture beyond top-down form-finding programs, by enabling architects to co-design in partnership with human and nonhuman collectives, which result from the production of post natural landscapes. Ultimately, vibrant architecture may operate as an ecological platform for human development that augments the liveliness of our planet, rather than diminishes it.",370.0,['Architecture'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oI_CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8oI_CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=288&source=gbs_api,Matter as a CoDesigner of Living Structures,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oI_CgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8oI_CgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"A Christmas carol in prose, being a ghost story of Christmas",['Charles Dickens'],"“A national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness.” --William Makepeace Thackeray The Western world typically thinks of Christmas as having a singular origin, away in a manger, but when you look at how the holiday is celebrated today, it’s hard to see a more powerful progenitor than Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. First published on December 17, 1843 as a novella, the story bestowed on Christmas its rich and complicated social character. Ebenezer’s epic Christmas Eve illustrates both the joy to be found in friends, family, and festive gatherings... and the dangers of letting such happiness and privilege blind you to the lives of the less fortunate. The story is a product of its time, a response to the ills of Victorian-era industrialization and the desire for tradition, but you only need to look at how varied the adaptations of A Christmas Carol have become--on stage, in film, and in song--to know that it is truly timeless. This exclusive edition of A Christmas Carol in Prose: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas is one adaptation not to miss. It is a scanned volume of the original novella--complete with original spooky title--enhanced with new illustrations and narration by artist and musician Jon Langford. Here Langford imagines the story as a stage production put on by a small West Yorkshire theater in 1916.

Theatricals,['Henry James'],"Theatricals is a book of two plays by Henry James published in 1894. The plays, Tenants and Disengaged, had failed to be produced, so James put them out in book form with a rueful preface about his inability to get the plays onto the stage. Based on a short story Flavien: Scènes de la vie contemporaine by Henri Rivière, Tenants tells of a widowed Englishman, Sir Frederick Byng, his son Norman, and his ward Mildred Stanmore. Norman and Mildred are in love, but Sir Frederick disapproves and forces his son to take a post in India. Meanwhile, Sir Frederick's former mistress, the long-widowed Eleanor Vibert, rents his lodge at Clere, near the family house. Eleanor brings along her son Claude, who (unknown to himself) is the illegitimate child of Sir Frederick. After many complications including some minor fisticuffs, Mildred and the returned Norman will marry, Claude learns the truth about his parentage and forgives his mother, and Eleanor refuses Sir Frederick's offer of marriage. Mildred embraces Eleanor to close the play on a bittersweet note. The other play published in this book, Disengaged, was based on James' own story, The Solution. At Brisket Place, forty miles outside London, a naive army captain, Llewellyn Prime, is made to believe that he has compromised Blandina Wigmore and must propose to her. He does so and is accepted. Many entrances and exits and much other stage business follow. Eventually, the youthful widow Mrs. Jasper gets Prime out of his engagement to Blandina and then accepts his marriage proposal. She was one of the plotters who had got him to propose to Blandina in the first place, but she quickly repented of her folly. Meanwhile, Blandina accepts Percy Trafford, who was also one of those who got Prime into the original mess, but regretted it soon afterwards.",442.0,['American drama'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wZ83AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wZ83AQAAIAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=403&source=gbs_api,Second Series: The Album.

Sheikh Abdullah-A Biography,['Syed Taffazull Hussain'],"Sir Charles Cunningham Watson the Political Secretary of the Viceroy made the following interesting observation in his own handwriting on the file regarding appointment of Lt.Col.Colvin as Prime Minister of Kashmir: ""I am definitely of the opinion that if Col.Colvin is to be of full value both to the Govt of India and the Durbar he must not draw less than Rs.4000/pm. Otherwise it will be said in the bazars that he is a cheap figurehead imported by the Maharajah on the advice of the Kashmiri Pandits. This last is true; he must not start with any other handicap."" This makes clear the reason for the appointment of Col.Colvin as the Prime Minister of the Maharaja and is referred to in Chapter 18 of this book. To put it in proper perspective for the modern reader the lowest paid government worker like the Government Silk Factory worker was paid about Rupees ten per month. Thus the salary recommended for the Prime Minister was 400 times the salary of the lowest paid worker. In modern India the lowest paid employee of the Central Government the peon is paid about Rupees 7000/p.m. while the Prime Minister gets a pay of about Rupees 160,000/p.m. i.e. just about 23 times the salary of the peon The Resident of Kashmir in his memorandum of September 1931 to the Government of India made the following observation about the July 1931 agitation: “.. At the present moment communal trouble, as such, has not come to notice. The tenseness of Muhammadan feeling is rather anti-Durbar than anti-Hindu.” This belies the attempt by some persons to dub the agitation by the people of Kashmir for their greater empowerment that began on 13th July 1931 as a communal riot. Amin Kamil (1924-2014) is a famous Kashmiri poet and writer.Appendix 3 of this edition has the english translation of his short story “Pyind Puran” which describes the sea change that came about in Kashmir after the abolition of feudalism by Sheikh Abdullah in1952. This is the first time that this story has been translated from Kashmiri into English. The story of Sheikh Abdullah’s life is a love story. It is the story of a man who loved Kashmir and “whose entire life was an expression of this love”. It is a story of his trials and tribulations, his successes and failures, of storms that he weathered and his halcyon days. It is a story that deserves to be read and reread for its sheer human interest by all those who have a place in their heart for that blighted paradise that is Kashmir.",487.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7RwFAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7RwFAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=425&source=gbs_api,The Crucial Period 1905-1939. 2019 Edition,No link available

Plain Tales from the Hills,['Rudyard Kipling'],"She was the daughter of Sonoo, a Hill-man, and Jadeh his wife. One year their maize failed, and two bears spent the night in their only poppy-field just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarth side; so, next season, they turned Christian, and brought their baby to the Mission to be baptized. The Kotgarth Chaplain christened her Elizabeth, and ""Lispeth"" is the Hill or pahari pronunciation. Later, cholera came into the Kotgarth Valley and carried off Sonoo and Jadeh, and Lispeth became half-servant, half-companion to the wife of the then Chaplain of Kotgarth. This was after the reign of the Moravian missionaries, but before Kotgarth had quite forgotten her title of ""Mistress of the Northern Hills."" Whether Christianity improved Lispeth, or whether the gods of her own people would have done as much for her under any circumstances, I do not know; but she grew very lovely. When a Hill girl grows lovely, she is worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon. Lispeth had a Greek face-one of those faces people paint so often, and see so seldom. She was of a pale, ivory color and, for her race, extremely tall. Also, she possessed eyes that were wonderful; and, had she not been dressed in the abominable print-cloths affected by Missions, you would, meeting her on the hill-side unexpectedly, have thought her the original Diana of the Romans going out to slay. Lispeth took to Christianity readily, and did not abandon it when she reached womanhood, as do some Hill girls. Her own people hated her because she had, they said, become a memsahib and washed herself daily; and the Chaplain's wife did not know what to do with her. Somehow, one cannot ask a stately goddess, five foot ten in her shoes, to clean plates and dishes. So she played with the Chaplain's children and took classes in the Sunday School, and read all the books in the house, and grew more and more beautiful, like the Princesses in fairy tales. The Chaplain's wife said that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a nurse or something ""genteel."" But Lispeth did not want to take service. She was very happy where she was.",336.0,['British'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4rlBAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4rlBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=441&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4rlBAQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-4rlBAQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Animation is the optical illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements. In film and video production, this refers to techniques by which each frame of a film or movie is produced individually. Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Anime is a medium of animation originating in Japan, with distinctive character and background aesthetics that visually set it apart from other forms of animation. An animated cartoon is a short, hand-drawn (or made with computers to look similar to something hand-drawn) moving picture for the cinema, TV or computer screen, featuring some kind of story or plot (even if it is a very short one). Manga is the Japanese word for comics and print cartoons. Outside of Japan, it usually refers specifically to Japanese comics. Special effects (abbreviated SPFX or SFX) are used in the film, television, and entertainment industry to visualize scenes that cannot be achieved by normal means, such as space travel.

The Count of Monte-Cristo,['Alexandre Dumas'],"The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",502.0,,4.0,68.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Short+Story&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=499&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&rdid=book-RyEEAAAAQAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Adventures of Oliver Twist,['Charles Dickens'],"At the heart of Charles Dickens's second novel, first published in 1838, is a story as much about crime and poverty as it is about justice and charity. Orphaned at birth, Oliver Twist grows up under the loveless, relentless watch of a workhouse. He runs away with hopes for a better life in London, only to become--at the hands of the unforgettable Artful Dodger--a guileless pawn in a gang of pickpockets and robbers working for Fagin, one of Dickens's most controversial villains. Full of ingenious plot twists, at turns thrilling, tragic, tender, and sharp-eyed, The Adventures of Oliver Twist is among Dickens's most enduring classics.

While the stated goal of the journey is to walk most of the way, the men find themselves using other forms of transport as they traverse the continent.

The Road Less Traveled By Michael Peres,['Michael Peres'],"My name is Michael Peres. I am a serial-entrepreneur who has founded and currently manages more than 5 start-ups. Yet, while most people find themselves constantly pressed for time and energy with just one job, I travel often; I work when I want, how I want; I find time to exercise; I give back to the community; I even, sometimes, work for free; and I do all of this with, and because of, ADHD. However, this book is not a success story. Nor is it a book about ADHD, or even disability. This is the story of how I gained confidence and learned how to overcome the limitations that were imposed on me. I was able to do this by operating off the well-worn path. I rejected classroom learning—showing up in class only for the final exams. I learned early on to take care of myself—while other teenagers went out shopping at the mall with their parents' money, I didn’t accept a single dollar from my parents past the age of 16. Instead, I operated a computer repair shop out of my house. Later, the prospect of working a 9-5 job in a cubicle just wasn’t an option for me. I credit my ADHD, and the challenges that resulted from this disability, with teaching me that in order to survive in this world, I had to engineer an innovative lifestyle for myself. I am sharing my story with you now because I believe that you, too, can break free of your constraints and even learn to use them to your advantage. If you are unhappy with the hand life has dealt you, let this short book be the foundation that gets you into the right state of mind and back in control of your own personal, professional, and financial success.

An All-American Murder,['John Oller'],"On a hot summer day in 1975, 14-year-old Christie Lynn Mullins left her neighborhood swimming pool with a friend, supposedly to attend a ""cheerleading contest"" behind a shopping center in Columbus, Ohio. Less than an hour later, she was found brutally beaten to death in the nearby woods. The neighborhood man who reported discovering her body was thought by many to be the true killer, but was never charged. Instead, the crime was pinned on a passive drifter with an IQ of 50, who confessed after six hours of interrogation. Two years later he was acquitted following a dramatic, Perry Mason-like trial full of surprise witnesses and testimony. ""An All-American Murder,"" by lawyer and journalist John Oller, is the story of a homicide that rocked the city of Columbus, Ohio nearly 40 years ago and remains unsolved to this day. Despite widespread belief that the original police investigation was flawed, law enforcement authorities never actively pursued this alternate suspect and refuse to discuss the case today. Friends, neighbors, and classmates of the victim, as well her family, firmly believe that justice was not done and that this ""cold case"" should be reopened. ""An All-American Murder"" has been described as ""a tragic, fascinating story well-told,"" and ""an exceptionally well written, insightful look into the angst that people can carry for decades when the criminal justice system is unable/unwilling to provide closure.""

Real Life: This is not a Game,['Nathan Nobis '],"""Real Life: This is not a Game - Personal Finance for Young Adults"" is a learning activity for young people about income and expenses, needs and wants and the jobs and careers needed to pay for daily life and beyond. It introduces kids and young adults to some basic concerns about personal finance: making money, paying bills, and more. Real life, hopefully, is full of lots of fun and exciting and special activities and events with family and friends, and just by yourself sometimes. But real life happens in the foreground of ordinary daily life. And lots of daily life is pretty ordinary stuff that many people often take for granted and don’t notice: living somewhere, sleeping somewhere, eating, deciding what to wear, not getting too hot or cold, and having some fun and relaxation too, among much more. For most adults, daily life happens because they have a job. They go usually somewhere (or they work from home), about 5 days a week, often for about 8 hours a day (or more!), to do work to get paid money so that they can pay for what they need and, sometimes, want for daily life. This is a game to introduce young people to what’s involved in daily life, specifically paying for what’s needed for daily life. What people need for daily life isn’t free - they have to pay for it, with money -- and money doesn’t grow on trees: nearly always, people have to work for it. This game focuses on expenses of daily living. This game involves a lot of internet research and fact finding: how much do the things required for daily life cost? And how much money does someone typically earn at different jobs? And it involves some basic math: what can someone afford, given a particular income (money earned) at a particular job? Thinking about these issues, and becoming aware of them, will help you get prepared for thinking about other financial (that is, money-related) questions, specifically those related to college and jobs.

Internet use and digital participation in everyday life,['Kristin Alfredsson Ågren'],"Background: Internet use is an integral part of everyday life in contemporary society, especially among young people. It is used to perform activities in everyday life by an increasing proportion of the population. However, knowledge about access to and use of the internet by adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) is scarce. More knowledge is needed about digital competencies and digital participation in their everyday lives. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis was to explore and describe internet access and use, and digital participation in everyday life among adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities. Designs and Methods: The thesis is based on results from three studies. In study I, the focus was on access to and use of the internet in the everyday settings of school/work, at home or during free time. Data was collected through observations, conversations, and follow-up interviews with 15 participants with ID, aged 13–24 years. The data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. In studies II and III, the design was cross-sectional and comparative, using national surveys on media and internet use from the Swedish Media Council, from which comparative data from reference groups could be gained. In study II, the national survey of adolescents on internet access and use was cognitively adapted for adolescents with intellectual disabilities, aged 13–20 years, in several steps. This made it accessible to a total selection of pupils from all the special schools in four diverse municipalities in two different regions of Sweden. In study III, the national survey of parents about opportunities and risks of internet use by their adolescents was used. The surveys were sent to a sample of n=318 adolescents with ID and their caregivers/parents. The responses were higher for the adolescents (n=114) than for the parents (n=99), and the response rate of the adolescents with ID was equivalent as that of the reference group, at 36% and 38% respectively. In study II, chi-square tests were used and, when necessary, Fisher’s exact test to analyse the data. In study III, analyses were carried out using Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression to control for confounding factors. Results: This thesis show that access to internet-enabled devices is lower for adolescents with ID than for the general population, except for tablets (study II). All internet activities, except playing games, are performed by fewer adolescents with ID compared to the reference group (study II) and the time spent on the internet activities is less (study III). Both environmental challenges and personal abilities present difficulties in internet access and use (study I) and affect digital participation for adolescents and young adults with ID. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of parents of adolescents with ID perceive opportunities associated with internet use and playing games, and a lower proportion perceive risks with negative consequences, or have concerns about online risks, compared with the reference group (study III). Significantly more parents of adolescents with ID state that their adolescent never uses smartphones or social media compared with the reference group. Strategies used to handle the digital environment and take part in internet activities were found and described, such as getting support from others, reducing the number of internet-enabled devices used and personalising them. Gaining access to internet content and performing internet activities was facilitated by picture-, word- and voice-based strategies, which were used by adolescents and young adults with both mild and moderate ID (study I). Conclusions: The conclusions are that the results show a lag in internet access and use and in digital participation by adolescents and young adults with ID. Adolescents and young adults with ID were accessing and using the internet in similar ways to the reference group, but to a lesser extent. The impact of the participants’ environment, together with their lack of certain abilities, make the development of digital competencies difficult for them. The result that parents of adolescents with ID perceive more opportunities and fewer risks associated with the internet provides new knowledge to support positive risk-taking in internet use and enable digital participation by adolescents and young adults with ID. Support can be developed in collaboration between the adolescent/young adult, their parents and teachers, and staff in community-based services and should involve physical, social and digital environmental adaptations. These can enable the development of digital competencies and minimise the lag in digital participation in everyday life, which is needed for participation in today’s digitalised society. Bakgrund till avhandlingen: Internetanvändning är en integrerad del av vardagen i dagens samhälle, särskilt bland ungdomar. Internet används för att utföra en mängd aktiviteter i vardagen av alltfler personer. Dock är kunskapen om tillgång till, samt användning av internet i vardagliga aktiviteter för ungdomar med intellektuell funktionsnedsättning (IF) bristfällig. Ökad kunskap behövs om digitala kompetenser och digital delaktighet i vardagen för ungdomar och unga vuxna med IF. Syftet med avhandlingen: Det övergripande syftet med denna avhandling var att utforska och beskriva tillgång till och användning av internet och digital delaktighet i vardagen bland ungdomar och unga vuxna med IF. Hur studierna genomfördes: Avhandlingen bygger på resultat från tre delstudier. I studie I samlades data in via observationer av och uppföljande intervjuer med 15 deltagare med IF, i åldern 13–24 år. Fokus låg på tillgång till och användning av internet i deras vardagliga miljöer: skola/arbete, hemma eller på fritiden. Data analyserades med kvalitativ innehållsanalys. I studie II och III var designen jämförande tvärsnittsstudier. Nationella enkäter från Statens Medieråd om medie- och internetanvändning användes där jämförande data från referensgrupper kunde erhållas. I studie II gjordes kognitiva anpassningar av den nationella enkäten om medie- och internetanvändning i flera steg för målgruppen ungdomar med IF i åldern 13–20 år. Anpassningen till en lättläst version av enkäten, med bildstöd för de som behövde det, gjorde den möjlig att skicka till ett totalurval av elever från alla särskolor i fyra olika kommuner i två olika regioner i Sverige. I studie III användes den nationella enkäten till föräldrar om möjligheter och risker med internet- och medieanvändning för deras ungdomar. Enkäterna skickades till ett urval av n = 318 ungdomar med IF och deras vårdgivare/förälder. Antalet svar var fler från ungdomarna (n = 114) jämfört med föräldrarna (n = 99), och svarsfrekvensen för ungdomar med IF var i paritet med referensgruppens, med 36% för ungdomar med IF, jämfört med 38% i referensgruppen. I studie II användes chi-två tester och vid behov Fisher’s exakta test, för analys av data. I studie III genomfördes analyser med Fisher’s exakta test och logistisk regression för att kontrollera för confounding faktorer dvs övriga faktorer som kan påverka. Resultaten som framkom i studierna: Resultaten av studierna visar att tillgången till enheter för internetanvändning är lägre för ungdomar med IF än för ungdomar generellt, med undantag för surfplattor (studie II). Alla internet-aktiviteter, utom att spela spel, utförs av en lägre andel ungdomar med IF jämfört med referensgruppen (studie II) och tiden som spenderas på internet-aktiviteterna är lägre för ungdomar med IF (studie III). Utmaningar i den omgivande miljön, såväl som personliga förmågor leder till svårigheter med internetuppkoppling och internetanvändning (studie I), och påverkar digital delaktighet för ungdomarna och de unga vuxna med IF. Möjligheter och risker med att använda internet visade att en signifikant högre andel föräldrar till ungdomar med IF uppfattar möjligheter förknippade med internetanvändning och att spela spel, och en lägre andel upplever risker med negativa konsekvenser, eller oroar sig för risker med internet jämfört med referensgruppen (studie III). Signifikant fler föräldrar till ungdomar med IF uppfattar dock att deras ungdomar aldrig använder smartphones och sociala medier jämfört med referensgruppen. Strategier, som ungdomar och unga vuxna med både lindrig och måttlig IF använder för att hantera den digitala miljön och delta i internet aktiviteter identifierades (studie I). Strategierna innebär; att få stöd från andra; att minska andelen enheter som används för internetanvändning och att främsta använda enheter som är utformade för/av person; samt att använda stödstrategier som är baserade på ord- bild- och röststöd för att kunna utföra internet-aktiviteter. Kunskapen som avhandlingen har bidragit med: Sammantaget visar resultaten en eftersläpning i tillgång till och användning av internet, liksom i digital delaktighet för ungdomar och unga vuxna med IF. Även om deltagarna har tillgång till och använder internet, är det i lägre utsträckning än referensgruppen. Faktorer i miljön tillsammans med deltagarnas personliga förmågor gör utvecklingen av digital kompetens svår för deltagarna. Resultatet att fler föräldrar till ungdomar med IF uppfattar möjligheter och färre uppfattar risker med internet är ny kunskap som kan stödja positivt risktagande i internetanvändning och möjliggöra digital delaktighet för ungdomar med IF. Stöd kan utvecklas i samarbete mellan ungdomar, deras föräldrar och personal, i både skola och kommunal omsorgsverksamhet, och involvera anpassningar av såväl fysisk, som social och digital miljö för utveckling av digitala kompetenser. Genom detta kan eftersläpningen i digital delaktighet i vardagen minimeras, vilket krävs för delaktighet i dagens digitaliserade samhälle",102.0,['Electronic books'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aOf_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aOf_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=69&source=gbs_api,Adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOf_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aOf_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Why Icebergs Float,['Andrew Morris'],"The topics explored in each chapter are based on hundreds of discussions the author has led with adult science learners over many years – people who came from all walks of life and had no scientific training, but had developed a burning curiosity to understand the world around them. This book encourages us to reflect on our own relationship with science and serves as an important reminder of why we should continue learning as adults. Praise for Why Icebergs Float 'Asking questions is an important scientific skill and sometimes we can only understand something when we can find the language to ask the right questions; books like this can be really helpful in this respect....This book is one of UCL’s open access books. This means that it can be downloaded as a free PDF from the UCL Press website. The commitment to making scientific works such as this freely available is very welcome. This book is very accessible and deserves to reach a wide audience.' - School Science Review 'Morris says in the prologue: ‘If you come away from this book with a greater interest in science and enhanced confidence about tackling it, the book will have served its purpose.’ So, don’t be afraid of science and give Why Icebergs Float a chance. You will absolutely enjoy it.' - Chemistry World '[Why Icebergs Float] draws on experiences and first-person narratives of adult learners who – out of genuine curiosity or embarrassment at their levels of scientific ignorance – have sought to catch-up on lost school science and get a better understanding of their surroundings as a result.' - Education Journal '‘The approach illustrates beautifully the influence of language on understanding.

Aged Out: How We're Failing Youth Transitioning Out of Foster Care,"['Sixto Cancel', 'Sarah Fathallah', 'Marina Nitze', 'Sarah Sullivan', 'Emily Wright-Moore']","Across the country, far too many young people age out of foster care into appalling circumstances. “Aging out” occurs when youth under the state’s custody are still in the foster care system when they reach either the age of majority or the end of extended foster care. Aging out refers to the moment in time when child welfare is no longer legally responsible for the youth, and the system abruptly stops providing services–usually when the youth turns either 18 or 21. Each year, thousands of youth age out of foster care, essentially legal orphans with no legal connection to family or a supportive network. Unfortunately, foster youth who go through the experience of aging out of foster care have statistically poor life prospects. Longitudinal studies across the country show very high rates of homelessness, incarceration, unemployment, and lack of access to health care among youth who aged out of foster care. These outcomes are disproportionately worse for Black, Native, and Brown youth, as well as queer and trans youth. This study is designed to understand the experiences of transition-age youth in their transition out of foster care and investigate: Why do poor outcomes for youth who age out of care persist? What are the current lived experiences of youth who age out of care? In what ways does child welfare continue to fall short for youth who age out of care?",94.0,['Family & Relationships'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bEluEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bEluEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=213&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bEluEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-bEluEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Fate of a Crown,['Lyman Frank Baum'],"The Fate of the Crown was the first novel of Baum's short-lived adult fiction career. Featuring an adventure story, political subtext, melodrama and a mystery plot, the work was a major success in the years after its publishing. Baum penned the novel under the pseudonym Schuyler Staunton not only because of the risk of shattering his successful young adult literature career with a risqué novel, but because the book's plot included historical figures of the period. Set in 1889 during the revolution that ended the Brazilian Empire, the novel mentions Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca, the first president of the Brazilian Republic and Emperor Pedro II, the last ruler of the Brazilian Empire. The novel's protagonist Robert Harcliffe takes a job as a secretary to a large company in Brazil, which he later learns is a front to a dangerous criminal enterprise. After evading death and becoming a member of the Brazilian resistance, Robert falls in love with the Republican leader's servant, Lesba, and works with her to uncover the mystery of some missing treasure that could be the key to the rebellion's success.",328.0,['American fiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=becQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=becQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=217&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=becQAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-becQAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Phingo!,"['Cheyenne J. Adamson', 'Pauline M. Adamson']","Phingo! Play and learn at the same time! Children love to play games, and Phingo!™ helps make learning fun. This lively, interactive phonics game engages students on three levels of sensory input: visual, auditory and kinesthetic, helping students learn to read, write and spell the English language. Play this engaging, bingo-style phonics game with the whole family, two students, a small group, or the entire classroom. Cleverly woven into the Phingo!™ cards are the 72 Orton phonograms – time-proven and kid-tested to build a strong foundation for reading, writing and spelling. Bingo and Phonics Unite The YesPhonics Phingo!™ game comes with a deck of 72 cards, each representing one of the Orton phonograms, which are vital to embedding the 45 sounds and sound combinations of the English language in the student’s memory. Phingo!™ also comes with six (6) reproducible bingo-style grid cards, just like a real bingo game. Complete playing instructions are also included. How it Works: The teacher chooses 24 phonograms from the deck of 72, based on the level of difficulty he or she desires to present. Each student gets a grid card of their own, and a crayon or pencil. (Grids can also be laminated to use over and over with dry-erase markers.) Fun for the Whole Family The teacher draws from the deck and reads aloud the first phonogram, along with its clever mnemonic caption. Students choose at random where they want to write the phonogram on their Phingo! grid cards. For example, the teacher may draw the phonogram /oa/. He or she would say the long ō sound, “that we may not use at the end of English words,” and then read the caption, “toad on the boat.” The students then write the phonogram /oa/ at random in one of the squares on their Phingo! grid card. The Search Is On When all 24 of the selected phonograms are presented, the whole deck is shuffled back together and the teacher begins to draw cards from the top of the deck. As the teacher reads each phonogram and caption, students try to find the phonogram on their grid card, circling the phonograms they recognize. Students call out “Phingo!” when they believe they have correctly circled five blocks in a row – across, down or diagonally. The teacher checks the accuracy of their work. If a student has an incorrect phonogram, he or she returns to their seat and the game goes on until one student has five correct phonograms in a row. A Break From the Routine Why it Works: Phingo!™ creates a unique learning opportunity that rigorously tests students’ knowledge and understanding of the sounds and sound combinations found in the English language. It also helps increase their interest in learning, in a fun and lively environment. Phingo!™ is an invaluable tool that gives students a break from their more rigorous curriculum of worksheets and memorization drills. The game is engaging and enjoyable, and it helps lower boredom and anxiety that can interfere with learning. From Beginner to Advanced Phingo!™ was also strategically created to accommodate various levels of difficulty, as the teacher can use increasingly complex phonograms and can task the students with using the phonogram in a sentence for bonus points. With the Phingo!™ phonics game for reading, writing and spelling English, learning becomes child’s play.",,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SaWRDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SaWRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=226&source=gbs_api,Phonetic Bingo with 72 Orton Phonograms,No link available

YesPhonics Flash Cards,['Pauline M. Adamson'],"Flash Card Phonogram Pack – Color Edition The mnemonic catch phrases in the YesPhonics™ Flash Card Phonogram Pack teach all 45 sounds heard in the English language. Capitalizing on the brilliant 72 Orton phonograms, each flash card illuminates every sound the letters (phonograms) make. They come in color for extra eye-popping attention. Kids love the color edition as it enhances the fun and informative illustrations they see. Combining phonics sounds with mnemonic aids and illustrations, the Flash Card Phonogram Pack, unique to YesPhonics, helps students learn to read and understand words without arduous, unproductive memorization. The Power of Phonograms Phonograms are tremendously powerful because serve as strong memory aids by linking a mnemonic (visual prompt) with a sound or sound sequence. The mnemonic “have a ball” for example, links the three sounds made by the letter “a” with a simple phrase and an illustration that completes the learning cycle. The YesPhonics signature mnemonics empower students with the ability to easily recall the sounds of the phonograms in the order of their use frequency. This enables the student to use the most frequently used sound first, which, more often than not, is the correct one to use. If it doesn’t work for that particular word, the second most commonly used sound is tried, and so on. Not All Phonograms are Created Equal Some phonograms, particularly consonants such as the letter “m” or “t”, are straightforward, with one sound. The letter “t” for example makes the sound in “top”, “tip” or “tape”. Add an “h”to that t”, however, and you have the two sounds made by the phonogram “th”. The YesPhonics phonogram flash cards teach the two distinct sounds of “th” as illustrated in the words breathe and breath. In fact, phonograms (letters and letter combinations) in the English language have up to six distinct sounds. Consider the phonogram “ough,” for example. Six distinct sounds of “ough” are illustrated in these words: dough, through, rough, cough, bought, plow. If these seems challenging you, imagine how confusing it can be for your student/s. Easy as Pie Fortunately, the YesPhonics flash cards help students embed these sounds and sound sequences into their memories, learning without the arduous effort of whole language (memorize and recite) systems. Learning the 72 Orton phonograms, in the order of the frequency, embeds a strong foundation upon which students build all their reading, writing and spelling skills. YesPhonics phonogram flash cards are easy as pie for the teacher to use, as the sounds of the phonograms and captions are readily available on the back of the card. While the student sees the big bold phonogram itself, the teacher reads from the back of the card, and the student repeats. Combining the visual code embedded in the phonogram, with the auditory process of hearing and repeating the sound or sound sequence, creates a powerful learning mechanism for the student. For teachers, the phonogram Flash Card Phonogram Pack presents a fun and easy diversion, allowing them to have fun with their students as they use a powerful tool in teaching students to read. The Gift that Keeps on Giving Fun, simple and engaging, the high-quality phonogram flash cards are also printed on 100-pound card stock to ensure that they will last for generations.",72.0,['Young Adult Nonfiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yaSRDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yaSRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=276&source=gbs_api,72 Orton-Spalding Flash Cards with signature Mnemonics,No link available

Conformity and Resistance in Mahabad,"['kameel Ahmady', 'کامیل احمدی ']","The field research for this book began in May 2006 in West Azerbaijan province in north-west Iran, the southern of this province also referred to as ‘Kurdistan’, in the town of Mahabad. It was undertaken in cooperation with the ‘Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults’ (Kanoon Fakri o Parverashi Kodek o Nojavan). During a three month period working with children and young adults as well as members of staff at the centre, parents and local leaders, photographic, textual and interview data was collected. The initial aim of this research was to examine the factors which shape a sense of belonging and place among young people in Mahabad, a town on the north-west periphery of Iran. I wanted to look at their consumption of local, national and transnational forms of media, and how this influenced their view of events, their local environment, and the ways they chose to narrate these. I used reflexive visual methods, asking them to take their own photographic pieces dealing with themes they saw as relevant to local current events and their place within these processes. The works they produced were then placed in a week long public exhibition in Mahabad, where further data was gathered in a Guest Book of reactions to the event, as well as participant observation notes taken at the time. The work produced by the young people shows the multiple and sometimes competing forces at work in the lives of young people in Iran, where idealised images about ‘the west’ can serve to challenge or reinforce their own sense of place. Conventions of media and popular culture ‘story telling’ – that is the discourses used to describe current affairs and social conditions in satellite television from Asia and Europe, films, print media such as newspapers, as well as vernacular trends – have shaped not only the choice of themes which are given priority by young people, but also the ways in which they view these themes and the relevance to their lives. Particularly with respect to issues of gender, there appears to be a strong desire for more public debate, but an ambivalence about the role of hybrid influences as positive or negative. Additionally, local forms of identity based on Kurdish resistance to a dominant nationalism are sometimes discernable, as is the overarching context of recent global events drawing Iran into direct political confrontations with western powers. #minority #minority_groups_in_Iran #ethnic #ethnic_minority #middle_East #ethnic_minority_groups _in_Kurdistan #Kurds_of_Iran #kurdistan Iranian_society #anthropology #kameel_ahmady #anthropolgy_ in_Iran #ethnography #ethnography_in_ran #kurds #mahabad #kurd #gender #women #youth #Iranian_youth",,['Young Adult Nonfiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SLNTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SLNTEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=286&source=gbs_api,"Media Consumption, Conformity and Resistance: A Visual Ethnography of Youth in Iranian Kurdistan",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SLNTEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SLNTEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

From Gherla to Washington,['Michael Klein'],"In his autobiography, Mike Klein describes growing up in Transylvania following the traumatic events of the Holocaust and the communist takeover of Romania.

Determinants of migration among rural youth throughout the world,"['de Brauw, Alan']","The decision of whether to migrate or not is one of several important decisions made by young men and women throughout the developing world. This paper uses panel data from five countries in Asia and Africa to examine the determinants of rural youth migration across five different countries, indirectly testing both broad and specific hypotheses related to migration. It finds that individual characteristics are more important determinants of migration than household or village characteristics. Further, it finds little evidence that credit constraints or relative deprivation are correlated with migration, holding other things constant. The difference between this result and those found in the literature regarding credit constraints implies credit constraints are geographically concentrated. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for migration influenced policy regarding youth, including the need for more and better migration data.",37.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0mXIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0mXIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=305&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0mXIDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0mXIDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Righting Canada's Wrongs: Residential Schools,['Melanie Florence'],"Canada's residential school system for aboriginal young people is now recognized as a grievous historic wrong committed against First Nations, Metis, and Inuit peoples. This book documents this subject in a format that will give all young people access to this painful part of Canadian history. In 1857, the Gradual Civilization Act was passed by the Legislature of the Province of Canada with the aim of assimilating First Nations people. In 1879, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald commissioned the ""Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds."" This report led to native residential schools across Canada. First Nations and Inuit children aged seven to fifteen years old were taken from their families, sometimes by force, and sent to residential schools where they were made to abandon their culture. They were dressed in uniforms, their hair was cut, they were forbidden to speak their native language, and they were often subjected to physical and psychological abuse. The schools were run by the churches and funded by the federal government. About 150,000 aboriginal children went to 130 residential schools across Canada. The last federally funded residential school closed in 1996 in Saskatchewan. The horrors that many children endured at residential schools did not go away. It took decades for people to speak out, but with the support of the Assembly of First Nations and Inuit organizations, former residential school students took the federal government and the churches to court. Their cases led to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the largest class-action settlement in Canadian history. In 2008, Prime Minister Harper formally apologized to former native residential school students for the atrocities they suffered and the role the government played in setting up the school system. The agreement included the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has since worked to document this experience and toward reconciliation. Through historical photographs, documents, and first-person narratives from First Nations, Inuit, and Metis people who survived residential schools, this book offers an account of the injustice of this period in Canadian history. It documents how this official racism was confronted and finally acknowledged.",130.0,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lSEHCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lSEHCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=308&source=gbs_api,The Devastating Impact on Canadas Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions Findings and Calls for Action,No link available

Love is the Only Solution,['The Supreme Master Ching Hai'],"In this booklet entitled “The Only Solution is Love,” international best-selling author, spiritual teacher, humanitarian and artist, Supreme Master Ching Hai, elucidates on the current situation in the world with regards to pandemics, climate change, conflicts and natural disasters. Furthermore, she explains the causes as well as the solutions. Through love for the animals, love for nature, each other, our families and even our enemies, we can create an Eden on Earth. The energy of LOVE will have a protective effect that will not only heal the planet but also elevate its inhabitants to higher state of consciousness. She goes on to urge us to turn our love into action to protect the meek, voiceless animals as well as all those who are in need. “Love can flourish or be destroyed even, though the essence of love can never be destroyed. There are deeds that can nourish love, there are deeds that can make love wither and die. I mean physical love. I mean the love in this realm. There are deeds that can make love grow, there are deeds that can make love diminish. We must cherish, treasure love if we find it. Support it.

Harpers's Weekly 1864 Part 3,['Walt H.

The focus is Warrenton town and Fauquier County Virginia, and beyond. About This Document -- Several years ago, Fauquier resident Paul Mellon kindly gifted a collection of Harper’s Weekly news magazines to the Fauquier Historical Society. They are a great educational source of engraved images highlighting Civil War events published when most newspapers were only words. The images illuminate the story. Harper’s artists were busy making on-scene images for woodcut engravings including many of Warrenton, Fauquier County and nearby environs in Northern Virginia. Warrenton, the county seat, was of military importance as a commercial crossroads including a railroad branch line terminus. It changed occupiers sixty-seven times during the War. It was the hub for Confederate Col. John S Mosby’s partisan raiders who were citizens by day and raiders at night. With daring raids they strategically kept the Union’s Army of the Potomac bottled up in Northern Virginia protecting /repairing supply lines and Washington DC. Fauquier was also home to many enslaved, about 48% of the population at the beginning of the War. The images are in high resolution and were digitally enhanced to give readers, students and researchers clarity.",125.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UFJDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UFJDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=352&source=gbs_api,"Civil War (1861-1865) Illustrations – Series 1864 Part 3 Featuring Warrenton, Fauquier County, Virginia and Beyond",No link available
"Understanding Computers, Smartphones and the Internet",['Ernie Dainow'],"Most introductory books about computers are long, detailed technical books such as those used in a computer science course or else tutorials that provide instructions on how to operate a computer with little description of what happens inside the machine.

Only the most important things about computers are covered. There is no math except some simple arithmetic. The only prerequisite is knowing how to use a web browser. As an alternative or adjunct to reading the book, you can watch a series of short videos by going to youtube.com and searching for “Understanding Computers, Smartphones and the Internet”. Only current day technology is covered. People who are interested in learning about how computers evolved from the earliest machines can read the companion book “A Concise History of Computers, Smartphones and the Internet”.

Omnidoxy,"['Cometan', 'Astronist Institution']","The Omnidoxy is the founding treatise of the Astronist religion and was solely authored by the philosopher and religious founder, Cometan. Partitioned into twelve disquisitions, each of which are further divided into hundreds of discourses, which are themselves titled by those which are known as rubrals, The Omnidoxy has been codified according to a unique writing structure known as insentence. The Omnidoxy not only forms the foundations of Astronism, but it remains the primary modern contributor and the book that ignited the establishment of the Astronic tradition of religion which encompasses the philosophy of Astronism. Introducing brand new philosophical concepts such as cosmocentricity, reascensionism, transcensionism, and sentientism amongst many others, The Omnidoxy remains the principal signifier of a new era in philosophy. The Omnidoxy births hundreds of new belief orientations, schools of thought, neologisms, disciplines of study, theories, and concepts which, when combined and considered collectively, have formed the basis of Astronism. The authorship of The Omnidoxy rests with the single individual philosopher, Cometan who began writing The Omnidoxy at the age of seventeen driven by what he terms as personal inspiration. The historical origination of The Omnidoxy rests in its authorship by Brandon Taylorian during early 21st century England, specifically in the northern county of Lancashire. Like in all textual criticism, the timing and location of the codification of The Omnidoxy is integral to understanding why and how it was written, especially by considering the influential factors impacting Taylorian during his construction of the text, particularly the cultural, political, religious, and social contexts of Taylorian's personal life and of wider society at the time. This forms an important branch of study within omnidoxicology known as omnidoxical criticism, or omnidoxical exegesis in which scholars study and investigate The Omnidoxy in order to discern conclusive judgements inspired by how, where, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances The Omnidoxy was written.",3357.0,['Philosophy'],5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UWSHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UWSHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=366&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UWSHDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UWSHDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Telling Tales,['David Blamires'],"Germany has had a profound influence on English stories for children. The Brothers Grimm, The Swiss Family Robinson and Johanna Spyri's Heidi quickly became classics but, as David Blamires clearly articulates in this volume, many other works have been fundamental in the development of English chilren's stories during the 19th Centuary and beyond. Telling Tales is the first comprehensive study of the impact of Germany on English children's books, covering the period from 1780 to the First World War. Beginning with The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, moving through the classics and including many other collections of fairytales and legends (Musaus, Wilhelm Hauff, Bechstein, Brentano) Telling Tales covers a wealth of translated and adapted material in a large variety of forms, and pays detailed attention to the problems of translation and adaptation of texts for children. In addition, Telling Tales considers educational works (Campe and Salzmann), moral and religious tales (Carove, Schmid and Barth), historical tales, adventure stories and picture books (including Wilhelm Busch's Max and Moritz) together with an analysis of what British children learnt through textbooks about Germany as a country and its variegated history, particularly in times of war.",460.0,['Literary Criticism'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R5lG5GSx3EYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R5lG5GSx3EYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=373&source=gbs_api,The Impact of Germany on English Children's,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R5lG5GSx3EYC&rdid=book-R5lG5GSx3EYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Quotes from the Quaid,"['Liaquat Merchant', 'Sharif Al Mujahid']","“Every Pakistani from the youngest child to your eldest scholar should read this wonderful book Quotes from the Quaid with pride and joy. Each page contains at least one inspiring thought culled from the life’s work of your great leader, illuminating Quaid-e-Azam’s humane brilliance and the wisdom of his remarkable mind”, writes Professor Stanley Wolpert in his foreword to the book. The decision by the Jinnah Society to publish Quotes from the Quaid as an e-book responds to the need for increasing awareness of Jinnah's leadership and the Pakistan Movement; the ever-increasing demand for this book from Pakistanis and the need to make Quotes from the Quaid available to all in and outside Pakistan easily as an e-book free of cost particularly in these troubled times caused by the Coronavirus all over the world. The book has previously sold more than 20,000 copies and was distributed to schools, colleges and universities for free. It was published first in 2007 by Oxford University Press and then again in 2020 by Lightstone Publishers. Mr. Liaquat Merchant, President of The Jinnah Society. said that the sole purpose of The Jinnah Society in bringing out Quotes from the Quaid in hard copy and now as an e-book constitutes one more effort to propagate and promote the principles, ideals, and vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, as a nation-building exercise and thus promote the development of democratic leaders in the role model of Mr Jinnah with particular emphasis on private honour and public integrity.",158.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mtT7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mtT7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=379&source=gbs_api,Foreword by Stanley Wolpert,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mtT7DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mtT7DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Museum Object Lessons for the Digital Age,['Haidy Geismar'],"Museum Object Lessons for the Digital Age explores the nature of digital objects in museums, asking us to question our assumptions about the material, social and political foundations of digital practices. Through four wide-ranging chapters, each focused on a single object – a box, pen, effigy and cloak – this short, accessible book explores the legacies of earlier museum practices of collection, older forms of media (from dioramas to photography), and theories of how knowledge is produced in museums on a wide range of digital projects. Swooping from Ethnographic to Decorative Arts Collections, from the Google Art Project to bespoke digital experiments, Haidy Geismar explores the object lessons contained in digital form and asks what they can tell us about both the past and the future. Drawing on the author’s extensive experience working with collections across the world, Geismar argues for an understanding of digital media as material, rather than immaterial, and advocates for a more nuanced, ethnographic and historicised view of museum digitisation projects than those usually adopted in the celebratory accounts of new media in museums. By locating the digital as part of a longer history of material engagements, transformations and processes of translation, this book broadens our understanding of the reality effects that digital technologies create, and of how digital media can be mobilised in different parts of the world to very different effects.",166.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q5VaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q5VaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=385&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Anthropology of Landscape,"['Christopher Tilley', 'Kate Cameron-Daum']","An Anthropology of Landscape tells the fascinating story of a heathland landscape in south-west England and the way different individuals and groups engage with it. Based on a long-term anthropological study, the book emphasises four individual themes: embodied identities, the landscape as a sensuous material form that is acted upon and in turn acts on people, the landscape as contested, and its relation to emotion. The landscape is discussed in relation to these themes as both ‘taskscape’ and ‘leisurescape’, and from the perspective of different user groups. First, those who manage the landscape and use it for work: conservationists, environmentalists, archaeologists, the Royal Marines, and quarrying interests. Second, those who use it in their leisure time: cyclists and horse riders, model aircraft flyers, walkers, people who fish there, and artists who are inspired by it. The book makes an innovative contribution to landscape studies and will appeal to all those interested in nature conservation, historic preservation, the politics of nature, the politics of identity, and an anthropology of Britain.",346.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kLg7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kLg7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=399&source=gbs_api,The Extraordinary in the Ordinary,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kLg7DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kLg7DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Efficient Learning for the Poor,['Helen Abadzi'],"""Large-scale efforts have been made since the 1990s to ensure that all children of the world go to school. But mere enrollment is not sufficient, students must become fluent in reading and calculation by the end of grade 2. Fluency is needed to process large amounts of text quickly and use the information for decisions that may ultimately reduce poverty. State-of-the-art brain imaging and cognitive psychology research can help formulate effective policies for improving the basic skills of low-income students. This book integrates research into applications that extend from preschool brain development to the memory of adult educators. In layman?'s terms, it provides explanations and answers to questions such as: Why do children have to read fast before they can understand what they read? How do health, nutrition, and stimulation influence brain development? Why should students learn basic skills in their maternal language? Is there such a thing as an untrained teacher? What signs in a classroom show whether students are getting a quality education? How must information be presented in class so that students can retain it and use it? What training techniques are most likely to help staff put their learning into use?

They are a great educational source of engraved images highlighting Civil War events published when most newspapers were only words. The images illuminate the story. Harper’s artists were busy making on-scene images for woodcut engravings including many of Warrenton, Fauquier County and nearby environs in Northern Virginia. Warrenton, the county seat, was of military importance as a commercial crossroads including a railroad branch line terminus. It changed occupiers sixty-seven times during the War. It was the hub for Confederate Col. John S Mosby’s partisan raiders who were citizens by day and raiders at night. With daring raids they strategically kept the Union’s Army of the Potomac bottled up in Northern Virginia protecting /repairing supply lines and Washington DC. Fauquier was also home to many enslaved, about 48% of the population at the beginning of the War.

Sexual Abuse of Young Children in Southern Africa,['Human Sciences Research Council'],"With contributions from leading legal and policy researchers, clinical practitioners and child development specialists in southern Africa, this volume is an invitation to reflect on the many-sided nature of sexual abuse of young children. Many of the contributors propose effective ways to prevent abuse or improve care and services for the many affected children and their families. The book is in five parts. The opening section confronts the realities of sexual abuse of pre-pubertal children and the way abuse is represented in the press. The second section discusses the individual and socio-cultural causes of child sexual abuse. Section three covers legal and policy responses to the problem, while the fourth section presents a series of accounts of interventions on behalf of abused children drawn from South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The book concludes with some critical reflections on research in this area.",508.0,"[""Abus sexuels à l'égard des enfants - Afrique australe""]",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rhznn_8QJY4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rhznn_8QJY4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=444&source=gbs_api,,No link available
The Septidoxy,"['Cometan', 'Wonderment']","The Septidoxy is the seventh disquisition contributing to the total of twelve which form The Omnidoxy, the philosophical treatise which founded the philosophy of Astronism, as solely authored by Cometan. The Septidoxy is of particular importance to the development of Astronism as well as setting the theme of the Omnidoxy due to the fact that it is entirely predicated upon explaining, exploring, and contemplating space exploration as a whole and the many different processes, events, practicalities, and emerging methods and beliefs from the Humanic Exploration of The Cosmos. While the Monodoxy contemplates The Cosmos, the Septidoxy contemplates space exploration and especially practical elements which will be integral to our conduct of space exploration activities. The Septidoxy is provided with its own inclusive discipline known as expology which entirely encompasses the philosophical contemplation of space exploration as distinct from the contemplation of space and celestials themselves which is encompassed within the monodoxical inclusive discipline of compendology. Contemplating questions such as the effects of space travel on humans both biologically and psychologically, the Septidoxy is entirely concerned with the practical viability of space exploration and the rationale for space exploration.",470.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RWaTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RWaTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=445&source=gbs_api,The Principles of Cosmic Exploration,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RWaTDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RWaTDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Monodoxy,"['Cometan', 'Astronist Institution']","The Monodoxy is a 275,000 word-long philosophical disquisition categorised as the first of twelve disquisitions that, when considered collectively, form The Omnidoxy, the founding treatise of the philosophy of Astronism established by Cometan. The disquisition comprises of hundreds of discourses which are themselves titled by rubrals and written according to a style and structure known as insentence. The Monodoxy's authorship solely rests with Cometan, the first Millettic philosopher and the founder of Astronism whom began writing The Monodoxy at the age of just seventeen through what he termed as personal inspiration. The Monodoxy has been said to formulate the thematic identity of the philosophy of Astronism due to its prominent focus on the elements, progeny, and phenomena of The Cosmos in a distinct way to all the other eleven disquisitions forming The Omnidoxy. Hundreds of new schools of thought, disciplines of study, and philosophical belief orientations hold their roots in The Monodoxy in addition to thousands of new terms, concepts, and theories which hold a distinguished originality and Cometanic style combined with an Astronic identity. There are a total of fifty-three discourses which constitute The Monodoxy, each of which holds its own special title known as a rubral which are used to provide overviews of the discourses to which they are associated.",1191.0,['Philosophy'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-guLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-guLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=456&source=gbs_api,The Principles of The Aesthetic Cosmos,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-guLDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book--guLDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Third language acquisition,"['Camilla Bardel', 'Laura Sánchez']","This book deals with the phenomenon of third language (L3) acquisition. As a research field, L3 acquisition is established as a branch of multilingualism that is concerned with how multilinguals learn additional languages and the role that their multilingual background plays in the process of language learning. The volume points out some current directions in this particular research area with a number of studies that reveal the complexity of multilingual language learning and its typical variation and dynamics. The eight studies gathered in the book represent a wide range of theoretical positions and offer empirical evidence from learners belonging to different age groups, and with varying levels of proficiency in the target language, as well as in other non-native languages belonging to the learner’s repertoire. Diverse linguistic phenomena and language combinations are viewed from a perspective where all previously acquired languages have a potential role to play in the process of learning a new language. In the six empirical studies, contexts of language learning in school or at university level constitute the main outlet for data collection. These studies involve several language backgrounds and language combinations and focus on various linguistic features. The specific target languages in the empirical studies are English, French and Italian. The volume also includes two theoretical chapters. The first one conceptualizes and describes the different types of multilingual language learning investigated in the volume: i) third or additional language learning by learners who are bilinguals from an early age, and ii) third or additional language learning by people who have previous experience of one or more non-native languages learned after the critical period. In particular, issues related to the roles played by age and proficiency in multilingual acquisition are discussed. The other theoretical chapter conceptualizes the grammatical category of aspect, reviewing previous studies on second and third language acquisition of aspect. Different models for L3 learning and their relevance and implications for representations of aspect and for potential differences in the processing of second and third language acquisition are also examined in this chapter. As a whole, the book presents current research into third or additional language learning by young learners or adults, considering some of the most important factors for the complex process of multilingual language learning: the age of onset of the additional language and that of previously acquired languages, social and affective factors, instruction, language proficiency and literacy, the typology of the background languages and the role they play in shaping syntax, lexicon, and other components of a L3. The idea for this book emanates from the symposium Multilingualism, language proficiency and age, organized by Camilla Bardel and Laura Sánchez at Stockholm University, Department of Language Education, in December 2016.",276.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZG4WEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZG4WEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=466&source=gbs_api,"Age, proficiency and multilingualism",No link available

Some Effects of DDT on the Guppy and the Brown Trout,['Susan Frances King'],"Editor's note: This paper was prepared under the direction of Assistant Professor Kathryn M. Eschenberg, Mount Holyoke College and was accepted by the Faculty in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts with Honor, 1961. Despite certain limitations, described below, the paper (somewhat condensed from the original) has been accepted for publication because (1) it is an unusual and excellent study by an undergraduate, and (2) so little information is available on the subject treated. Biometricians may criticize the paper from the standpoint of small numbers and need for replication. One reviewer says: ""One of the most interesting observations related to the apparent increase in resistance following exposure to effectively sublethal levels. Part of the increase, but likely only part, was due to the previous selective killing of weaker individuals. Good experimental procedure would require that this test be repeated, with parallel series of previously unexposed fish....There is need for a replicated study of numbers of young born to guppies held in DDT, especially because the numbers are so small."" It is the Editor's hope that the limitations of the paper may stimulate further work in this important area.",32.0,['Brown trout'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RD8MTLAVEewC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RD8MTLAVEewC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=491&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RD8MTLAVEewC&rdid=book-RD8MTLAVEewC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Economics of Gender in Mexico,"['Elizabeth G. Katz', 'Maria Cecilia Correia']","Extrait de la couverture : ""Mexico has witnessed major demographic, social, and economic changes since the 1960s. In this context, the distinct roles of men and women have also changed, as exemplifies by female labor force participation, which almost tripled in the second half of the 20th century. However, traditional gender roles continue to constrain men's and women's opportunities and well-being in Mexico. [The book] examines these issues from a life-cycle and economic perspective. It looks at the way traditional gender roles shape male and female economic activities and outcomes, beginning whith school-age children and their education patterns, continuing with the labor force participation of adults in rural and urban areas, and ending with the situation of elderly men and women. The book contains new material on changes in the maquiladora sector - which has historically provided important work opportunities for women - as well as the distinct impact of ejido reform on rural men and women.""",322.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=brIrJ_lS9BAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=brIrJ_lS9BAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=495&source=gbs_api,"Work, Family, State, and Market",No link available
The Dynamics of Opportunity in America,"['Irwin Kirsch', 'Henry Braun']","Across the country, our children are beginning life from very different starting points. Some have aspirations and believe they can be achieved. For too many others, aspirations are tempered, if not dashed, by the sobering realities of everyday life. These different starting points place children on distinctly different trajectories of growth and development, ultimately leading to vastly different adult outcomes. How did we get to a place where circumstances of birth have become so determinative? And what must we do, within communities and across our country, to better equalize opportunity for more Americans – both young and old? The editors of this volume contend that if, as a nation, we do nothing, then we will continue to drift apart, placing an unsustainable strain on the nation’s social fabric and the character of its democracy. Consequently, understanding the dynamics governing the distribution and transmission of opportunity – and transforming this understanding into policies and programs – is critical for not only the life outcomes of individual Americans and their children, but also the country as a whole. The goal of Educational Testing Service’s Opportunity in America initiative is to explore these powerful dynamics and to describe and convey them in a way that advances the national conversation about why we must take action – and how best to do so. This volume contains 14 chapters, including an epilogue, written by leaders from a range of fields including education, economics, demography, and political science. Collectively, they not only illuminate key aspects of the problem but also offer suggestions of what policies, programs, and changes in practices could begin to reverse the trends we are seeing. Written in an engaging style, this volume constitutes an essential foundation for informed discussion and strategic analysis.",489.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nNhCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nNhCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=496&source=gbs_api,Evidence and Perspectives,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nNhCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nNhCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition 2020,"['Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ', 'World Food Programme   ', 'World Health Organization   ', ""United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\xa0""]","The 2020 report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the Asia and Pacific region, provides an update on progress towards the 2030 targets (SDGs and WHA) at the regional and country level. Selected indicators look at undernourishment, food insecurity, childhood stunting, wasting and overweight, adult overweight, child minimum acceptable diet, exclusive and continued breastfeeding, and anaemia in women and children. While the region continues to work towards ending all forms of malnutrition and achieving Zero Hunger, progress on food security and nutrition has slowed, and the Asia and Pacific region is not on track to achieving 2030 targets. About 350.6 million people in the Asia and Pacific region are estimated to have been undernourished in 2019, about 51 percent of the global total. An estimated 74.5 million children under five years of age were stunted and a total of 31.5 million were wasted in the Asia and Pacific region. The majority of these children in the region live in Southern Asia with 55.9 million stunted and 25.2 million wasted children. Estimates predict a 14.3 percent increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe wasting among children under 5 years of age, equal to an additional 6.7 million children, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With basic food prices and disposable incomes influencing household decisions on food and dietary intake, they are critical to improve food security and nutrition in the region. However, in the Asia and Pacific region, 1.9 billion people are unable to afford a healthy diet, driven by high prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products, making it impossible for the poor to achieve healthy diets.In Part 2, the 2020 report promotes a systems approach to healthy maternal and child diets, involving and coordinating institutions and actors in the Food, Water and Sanitation, Health, Social Protection and Education systems, to collectively create the enabling environment for healthy diets. Integration of healthy diets and nutrition-focused Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) mainstreamed throughout these systems will lead to greater uptake and sustainability of healthy behaviours and caregiver’s knowledge.",120.0,['Health & Fitness'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pigXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pigXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=507&source=gbs_api,Maternal and child diets at the heart of improving nutrition,No link available

The Aftermath of Civil War,"['Siyan Chen', 'Norman Loayza', 'Marta Reynal-Querol']","Using an ""event-study"" methodology, this paper analyzes the aftermath of civil war in a cross-section of countries. It focuses on those experiences where the end of conflict marks the beginning of a relatively lasting peace. The paper considers 41 countries involved in internal wars in the period 1960-2003. In order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the aftermath of war, the paper considers a host of social areas represented by basic indicators of economic performance, health and education, political development, demographic trends, and conflict and security issues. For each of these indicators, the paper first compares the post- and pre-war situations and then examines their dynamic trends during the post-conflict period. The paper concludes that, even though war has devastating effects and its aftermath can be immensely difficult, when the end of war marks the beginning of lasting peace, recovery and improvement are indeed achieved.",29.0,['Civil Conflict'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kaEF81Ujr0UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kaEF81Ujr0UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Young+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=569&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Readiness or resistance?,['Afrah Abdulla'],"This thesis is about newly arrived adult migrants’ meaning making and learning in Swedish society during the two years’ introduction period, after they have received the residence permit. I have specifically studied Arabic speaking adults’ meaning making and learning, by carrying out observations and individual in-depth interviews with 12 migrants. The introduction period consists mainly of three so called introduction measures; the civic orientation course, Swedish for immigrants (SFI), and different work related activities, such as internship at different work places. The results show that etablering is about shaping the newly arrived adult migrants into ”good” citizens, through the introduction measures, among other things in the civic orientation course, which is regulated through the policy documents, and which so to say provides meaning to the newly arrived. The “good” citizen has some specific characteristics, which, roughly, are that he or she is independent (and advocates individuality), free, equality thinking, secularized, law-abiding (which includes being honest), responsible, and a “good” parent. These characteristics are expressed in different ways in the civic orientation course, for instance through the course material. The Swedish society is described as something desirable, and different from what is implied to be ”Arabic” values and ways of thinking. The idea of the “good” citizen appears to aim at constructing the adult migrants’ (and their families’) identity, something which many of the study’s respondents make a resistance to. As concerns the migrant’s new experiences, it is, for example, those which the migrant get through the contact with the Swedish Public Employment Service (SPES) that affect the meaning making in the new society. The meaning which most of the respondents have made of the SPES’s measures for them is that this authority only offers “prepackaged” solutions, and does not provide the help or support that they need. Also the experiences which the migrant has in the civic orientation course, and the meaning which ”old” migrants give to him or her, play a role when he or she makes meaning of Sweden and Swedes, and of his or her new life situation. Further, it has been shown that it is those experiences that the adult individual has been socialized through, and those which he or she has gained through work or education in his or her country of origin, which affect his or her meaning making in Sweden. It is mostly values which concern child upbringing and religion that lead to a certain understanding and construction of one’s new life. These values, when related to the values which are included in the ”good” citizen idea, also lead to either a resistance or a readiness towards the meaning giving that is embedded in the ”good” citizen notion.

Introduktionsperioden består främst av tre s.k. etableringsinsatser; kursen i samhällsorientering, svenska för invandrare (SFI) samt olika arbetsrelaterade och arbetsfrämjande insatser, såsom praktik på olika arbetsplatser. Resultatet visar att etablering handlar om att forma de vuxna nyanlända till ”goda” medborgare, genom etableringsinsatserna, bl.a. i samhällsorienteringskursen, som regleras genom policydokumenten, och som s.a.s. tillhandahåller mening för de nyanlända. Den ”goda” medborgaren har vissa specifika kännetecken, vilka, i grova drag, är att han eller hon är självständig (och förespråkar individualitet), fri, jämlikhetstänkande, sekulariserad, laglydig (vilket inkluderar ärlig), ansvarsfull, och en ”god” förälder. Dessa karaktärsdrag kommer på olika sätt till uttryck i samhällsorienteringskursen, exempelvis genom kursmaterialet. Det svenska samhället framställs då också som något eftersträvansvärt, och skilt från det som antyds vara ”arabiska” värderingar och tänkesätt. Föreställningen om den ”goda” medborgaren verka syfta till att konstruera den vuxna nyanländas (och dennas familjs) identitet, något som många av studiens respondenter gör motstånd mot. Vad gäller migrantens nya erfarenheter, är det exempelvis de som migranten har fått genom kontakt med Arbetsförmedlingen som påverkar meningsskapandet i det nya samhället. Den mening som de flesta av respondenterna har gjort om Arbetsförmedlingens insatser för dem är att denna myndighet enbart erbjuder dem ”förpaketerade” lösningar, och inte tillhandahåller den hjälp eller det stöd som de behöver. Även erfarenheter som migranten gör i samhällsorienteringskursen, samt den mening som ”gamla” migranter förmedlar till honom eller henne, spelar roll för hur vederbörande skapar mening om Sverige och svenskar, och om sin nya livssituation. Dessutom har det visat sig att det är de erfarenheter som den vuxna har blivit socialiserad genom, samt de som han eller hon har fått genom utbildning eller arbete i ursprungslandet, som påverkar migrantens meningsskapande i Sverige. Det är främst värderingar som är knutna till barnuppfostran och religion som leder till en viss förståelse och konstruktion av ens nya liv. Dessa värderingar leder också, när de stöts mot de värderingar som ingår i föreställningen om den ”goda” medborgaren, antingen till ett motstånd mot eller en beredvillighet inför det meningsgivande som ingår i den ”goda” medborgaren.",180.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-uc_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-uc_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=New+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=6&source=gbs_api,"Newly arrived adult migrants' experiences, meaning making, and learning in Sweden",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-uc_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book--uc_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

(Also known as Vlad the Impaler, an evil villain from history). Blair – Chrissy Peebles Jezebel – Kristen Middleton Victoria – W.J. May Lotus – C.J. Pinard The Daughters of Darkness is a series of female heroines who may or may not know each other, but all have the same father, Vlad Montour. Lotus Don't let the pretty name fool you. This daughter is no delicate flower. Lotus grew up orphaned. Having no idea who her real parents were, she's been drifting around the U.S. for over 100 years moving every 15 years or so since she just doesn't seem to age. She'd figured out on her own that she had to be at least part vampire, as she needs to suck on a few blood bags a month to survive. Working as a detective with the Denver P.D., Lotus is searching desperately for a serial killer who is murdering the homeless of the city. Except these are not ritualistic or thrill killings. These victims have been drained of blood and Lotus knows, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they have been committed by a vampire. Her search will take her to Las Vegas, and that is where the true adventure will begin, where she learns who has been searching for her. This is part I of Lotus's story.

United States Code,['United States'],"""The United States Code is the official codification of the general and permanent laws of the United States of America. The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, enacted between January 2, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law.

World Development Report 2019,['World Bank'],"Work is constantly reshaped by technological progress. New ways of production are adopted, markets expand, and societies evolve. But some changes provoke more attention than others, in part due to the vast uncertainty involved in making predictions about the future. The 2019 World Development Report will study how the nature of work is changing as a result of advances in technology today. Technological progress disrupts existing systems. A new social contract is needed to smooth the transition and guard against rising inequality. Significant investments in human capital throughout a person’s lifecycle are vital to this effort. If workers are to stay competitive against machines they need to train or retool existing skills. A social protection system that includes a minimum basic level of protection for workers and citizens can complement new forms of employment. Improved private sector policies to encourage startup activity and competition can help countries compete in the digital age. Governments also need to ensure that firms pay their fair share of taxes, in part to fund this new social contract.

"Evidence from Scripture and History of the Second Coming of Christ about the Year 1843, Exhibited in a Course of Lectures",['William Miller'],"Over the centuries, God has revealed to His prophets clues to the upcoming events of the end times. Such prophetic language often differs from other parts of Scripture, employing highly figurative details. God in His wisdom has imparted these clued to various prophets spanning centuries of time, civilizations and social levels, thus providing the modern-day reader a highly complex, yet complete prophetic puzzle pointing us forward to final days in earth's history. Therefore, a complete study is necessary to understanding Bible prophecy as the act of overlooking one prophet or vision will render an incomplete understanding. William miller was a simple New York farmer when God called him to become one of the cornerstones of the great revival movement that eventually formed the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist church. A self-proclaimed agnostic, Miller had little to do with God or the bible for much of his adult life. However, as the Holy Spirit worked on his heart, Miller began an extensive study of the Scriptures where he found Christ as his personal friend and Saviour. Evidence From Scripture and History explores into the heart of many Bible prophecies both known and ambiguous. Backing up all claims wich Scripture and references, Miller takes the reader on an exhaustive study of Bible prophecy in this modern-day repring of an early advent study. - INTRODUCTION. LECTURE I.

Synopsis: Global Nutrition Report 2015,['International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)'],"As we move into the post-2015 era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world faces many seemingly intractable problems. Malnutrition should not be one of them. Countries that are determined to make rapid advances in malnutrition reduction can do so, and the incentives to improve nutrition are strong. Good nutrition provides a vital foundation for human development, central to meeting our full potential. When nutrition status improves, it leads to a host of positive outcomes for individuals and families. Many more children will live to see their fifth birthdays, their growth will be less disrupted, and they will gain in height and weight. They will learn more in school because their brain function is not impaired. As a result of this positive early environment, as adults they will have better jobs and get ill less often.

Systematics and Phylogeny of Weevils,"['Rolf Oberprieler', 'Adriana Marvaldi', 'Chris Lyal']","This Special Issue on the Systematics and Phylogeny of Weevils presents 31 new research papers on one of the most diverse and successful groups of animals on Earth, the beetle superfamily Curculionoidea.

The papers in this memorial issue span weevil faunas from all over the globe, including South and Central America, Africa, Europe and the Near East, South-East Asia, New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. They include major advances on the phylogeny and classification of the “broad-nosed” weevils (Entiminae), on the weevils associated with American cycads and on the unique extinct weevil fauna preserved in the 100-million-year-old Burmese amber, when weevils started to diversify alongside the oldest angiosperm plants. They comprise a tribute to Willy Kuschel, the proceedings of a weevil symposium held in his honor in 2016 in Orlando, Florida, 24 systematic studies (including seven phylogenetic analyses) and five other contributions on the diversity, biology, distribution, evolution and fossil history of weevils.

WHO Global Report on Falls Prevention in Older Age,['World Health Organization'],"The WHO Falls Prevention for Active Ageing model provides an action plan for making progress in reducing the prevalence of falls in the older adult population. By building on the three pillars of falls prevention, the model proposes specific strategies for: 1. Building awareness of the importance of falls prevention and treatment; 2. Improving the assessment of individual, environmental, and societal factors that increase the likelihood of falls; and 3. For facilitating the design and implementation of culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions that will significantly reduce the number of falls among older persons. The model provides strategies and solutions that will require the engagement of multiple sectors of society. It is dependent on and consistent with the vision articulated in the WHO Active Ageing Policy Framework. Although not all of the awareness, assessment, and intervention strategies identified in the model apply equally well in all regions of the world, there are significant evidence-based strategies that can be effectively implemented in all regions and cultures. The degree to which progress will be made depends on to the success in integrating falls prevention strategies into the overall health and social care agendas globally. In order to do this effectively, it is necessary to identify and implement culturally appropriate, evidence-based policies and procedures. This requires multi-sectoral, collaborations, strong commitment to public and professional education, interaction based on evidence drawn from a variety of traditional, complementary, and alternative sources. Although the understanding of the evidence-base is growing, there is much that is not yet understood. Thus, there is an urgent need for continued research in all areas of falls prevention and treatment in order to better understand the scope of the problem worldwide.

The Crossley ID Guide: Raptors,"['Richard Crossley', 'Jerry Liguori', 'Brian Sullivan']","Part of the revolutionary ""Crossley ID Guide"" series, this is the first raptor guide with lifelike scenes composed from multiple photographs--scenes that allow you to identify raptors just as the experts do. Experienced birders use the most easily observed and consistent characteristics--size, shape, behavior, probability, and general color patterns. The book's 101 scenes--including thirty-five double-page layouts--provide a complete picture of how these features are all related. Even the effects of lighting and other real-world conditions are illustrated and explained. Detailed and succinct accounts from two of North America's foremost raptor experts, Jerry Liguori and Brian Sullivan, stress the key identification features. This complete picture allows everyone from beginner to expert to understand and enjoy what he or she sees in the field. The mystique of bird identification is eliminated, allowing even novice birders to identify raptors quickly and simply. Comprehensive and authoritative, the book covers all thirty-four of North America's diurnal raptor species (all species except owls). Each species is featured in stunning color plates that show males and females, in a full spectrum of ages and color variants, depicted near and far, in flight and at rest, and from multiple angles, all caught in their typical habitats. There are also comparative, multispecies scenes and mystery photographs that allow readers to test their identification skills, along with answers and full explanations in the back of the book. In addition, the book features an introduction, and thirty-four color maps accompany the plates. Whether you are a novice or an expert, this one-of-a-kind guide will show you an entirely new way to look at these spectacular birds.The most complete guide to North American raptors, written by some of the foremost experts The first raptor guide using Richard Crossley's acclaimed, innovative composite images that show birds as they actually appear in the field 101 stunning color plates--including thirty-five double-page layouts--composed from thousands of photographs Comparative, multispecies plates and photos of mystery species that allow readers to test their growing identification skills Complete with introduction, 34 color maps, and detailed species accounts",17.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iaRF5lRR4OUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iaRF5lRR4OUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=New+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=429&source=gbs_api,,No link available
No Easy Answers,Unknown,"No Easy Answers is the first comprehensive study of US sex offender registration, community notification and residency restriction laws, their public safety impact, and the effect they have on former offenders and their families. It concludes the laws are poorly crafted and misguided, failing to protect children from sex crimes but making it nearly impossible for former offenders to rebuild their lives. In many states, everyone convicted of a sex crime must register and the requirement can last for life. The requirements are overbroad in scope and overlong in duration. As a result, there are more than 600,000 registered sex offenders, including individuals convicted of sexual sex between teenagers, prostitution, and public urination, as well as those who committed their only offenses decades ago. Unfettered public access to online sex offender registries exposes registrants to harassment, ostracism, and even violence, with little evidence that this form of community notification protects anyone from sexual violence. Residency restrictions prohibit former offenders from living within a designated distance (anywhere from 500 to 2,500 feet) from places where children gather. The restrictions have the effect of banishing former offenders from entire towns, forcing them to live far from home, families, jobs, and treatment, and hindering law-enforcement supervision. The restrictions may have no impact on the likelihood of recidivism. Sex offender laws reflect public concern that children are at grave risk of sexual abuse by strangers who are repeat offenders. The real risks children face are quite different: statistics demonstrate that most sexual abuse of children is committed by family members or persons known and often trusted by the victim, and by someone who has not previously been convicted of a sex offense. The laws also reflect the widely shared but erroneous belief that sex offenders continually repeat their offenses. Authoritative studies, however, indicate that three out of four adult offenders do not reoffend.",141.0,['Sex and law'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fzQwVXKfjt4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fzQwVXKfjt4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=New+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=430&source=gbs_api,Sex Offender Laws in the US.,No link available

The three played there as girls until the day that their games uncovered something dark and twisted in the motel's past, something that ruined their friendship forever. Now adults, Piper and Margot have tried to forget what they found that fateful summer, but their lives are upended when Piper receives a panicked midnight call from Margot, with news of a horrific crime for which Amy stands accused. Suddenly, Margot and Piper are forced to relive the time that they found the suitcase that once belonged to Silvie Slater, the aunt that Amy claimed had run away to Hollywood to live out her dream of becoming Hitchcock's next blonde bombshell leading lady. As Margot and Piper investigate, a cleverly woven plot unfolds--revealing the story of Sylvie and Rose, two other sisters who lived at the motel during its 1950s heyday.

HIV and AIDS,"['Alice Welbourn', 'Joanna Hoare']","This book looks at the key challenges of HIV and AIDS from a gender perspective, and describes positive responses in areas of the world as diverse as Cambodia, South Africa, the UK, and Papua New Guinea. The impact of HIV on women and men across the world are devastating and wide-ranging. Girls may have to drop out of school to look after sick relatives, boys to earn money. The death of working-age adults can mean that surviving family members struggle to get by, with grandparents shouldering the burden of looking after orphaned grandchildren, often in dire poverty. Young women may have to resort to sex work and other risky survival strategies to support themselves and their families. Young men are growing up with ideas about masculinity that include violence and the sexual domination of women, contributing to the spread of HIV.

Obesity,['World Health Organization'],"This report issues a call for urgent action to combat the growing epidemic of obesity, which now affects developing and industrialized countries alike. Adopting a public health approach, the report responds to both the enormity of health problems associated with obesity and the notorious difficulty of treating this complex, multifactorial disease. With these problems in mind, the report aims to help policy-makers introduce strategies for prevention and management that have the greatest chance of success. The importance of prevention as the most sensible strategy in developing countries, where obesity coexists with undernutrition, is repeatedly emphasized. Recommended lines of action, which reflect the consensus reached by 25 leading authorities, are based on a critical review of current scientific knowledge about the causes of obesity in both individuals and populations. While all causes are considered, major attention is given to behavioural and societal changes that have increased the energy density of diets, overwhelmed sophisticated regulatory systems that control appetite and maintain energy balance, and reduced physical activity. Specific topics discussed range from the importance of fat content in the food supply as a cause of population-wide obesity, through misconceptions about obesity held by both the medical profession and the public, to strategies for dealing with the alarming prevalence of obesity in children. ""... the volume is clearly written, and carries a wealth of summary information that is likely to be invaluable for anyone interested in the public health aspects of obesity and fatness, be they students, practitioner or researcher."" - Journal of Biosocial Science",267.0,['Cooking'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AvnqOsqv9doC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AvnqOsqv9doC&printsec=frontcover&dq=New+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=504&source=gbs_api,Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic,No link available
The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders,"['Organisation mondiale de la santé', 'World Health Organization', 'WHO', 'WHO Staff']",Provides clinical descriptions diagnostic guidelines and codes for all mental and behavioural disorders commonly encountered in clinical psychiatry. The book was developed from chapter V of the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines were finalized after field testing by over 700 clinicians and researchers in 110 institutes in 40 countries making this book the product of the largest ever research effort designed to improve psychiatric diagnosis. Every effort has been made to define categories whose existence is scientifically justifiable as well as clinically useful. The classification divides disorders into ten groups according to major common themes or descriptive likeness a new feature which makes for increased convenience of use. For each disorder the book provides a full description of the main clinical features and all other important but less specific associated features. Diagnostic guidelines indicate the number balance and duration of symptoms usually required before a confident diagnosis can be made. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are also provided together with conditions to be considered in differential diagnosis. The guidelines are worded so that a degree of flexibility is retained for diagnostic decisions in clinical work particularly in the situation where provisional diagnosis may have to be made before the clinical picture is entirely clear or information is complete. ...

Africa regional overview of food security and nutrition 2020,"['Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations', 'United Nations Economic Commission for Africa', 'African Union Commission']","Africa is not on track to meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 targets to end hunger and ensure access by all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round and to end all forms of malnutrition. The number of hungry people on the continent has risen by 47.9 million since 2014 and now stands at 250.3 million, or nearly one-fifth of the population. The 2017, 2018 and 2019 editions of this report explain that this gradual deterioration of food security was due to conflict, weather extremes, and economic slowdowns and downturns, often overlapping. A continued worsening of food security is expected also for 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to hunger, across all countries in Africa millions of people suffer from widespread micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity are emerging as significant health concerns in many countries. This report shows that the food system in Africa does not provide food at a cost that makes nutritious food affordable to a majority of the population, and this is reflected in the high disease burden associated with maternal and child malnutrition, high body-mass, micronutrient deficiencies and dietary risk factors. The report also shows that current food consumption patterns impose high health and environmental costs, which are not reflected in food prices. The findings presented in this report highlight the importance of prioritizing the transformation of food systems to ensure access to affordable and healthy diets for all, produced in a sustainable manner.",168.0,['Technology & Engineering'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M0s2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=M0s2EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=New+Adult&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=523&source=gbs_api,Transforming food systems for affordable healthy diets,No link available

Children and Peace,"['Nikola Balvin', 'Daniel J. Christie']","This open access book brings together discourse on children and peace from the 15th International Symposium on the Contributions of Psychology to Peace, covering issues pertinent to children and peace and approaches to making their world safer, fairer and more sustainable. The book is divided into nine sections that examine traditional themes (social construction and deconstruction of diversity, intergenerational transitions and memories of war, and multiculturalism), as well as contemporary issues such as Europe’s “migration crisis”, radicalization and violent extremism, and violence in families, schools and communities. Chapters contextualize each issue within specific social ecological frameworks in order to reflect on the multiplicity of influences that affect different outcomes and to discuss how the findings can be applied in different contexts. The volume also provides solutions and hope through its focus on youth empowerment and peacebuilding programs for children and families. This forward-thinking volume offers a multitude of views, approaches, and strategies for research and activism drawn from peace psychology scholars and United Nations researchers and practitioners. This book's multi-layered emphasis on context, structural determinants of peace and conflict, and use of research for action towards social cohesion for children and youth has not been brought together in other peace psychology literature to the same extent. Children and Peace: From Research to Action will be a useful resource for peace psychology academics and students, as well as social and developmental psychology academics and students, peace and development practitioners and activists, policy makers who need to make decisions about the matters covered in the book, child rights advocates and members of multilateral organizations such as the UN.",405.0,['Psychology'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tOK3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tOK3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=15&source=gbs_api,From Research to Action,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tOK3DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-tOK3DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Children's Exploration and Cultural Formation,"['Mariane Hedegaard', 'Elin Eriksen Ødegaard']","This open access book examines the educational conditions that support cultures of exploration in kindergartens. It conceptualises cultures of exploration, whether those cultures are created through children’s own engagement or are demanded of them through undertaking specific tasks within different institutional settings. It shows how the conditions for children’s exploration form a web of activities in different settings with social relationships, local landscapes and artefacts. The book builds on the understanding of cultural traditions as deeply implicated in the developmental processes, meaning that local considerations must be reflected in education for sustainable futures. Therefore the book examines and conceptualises exploration and cultural formation through locally situated cases and navigates toward global educational concepts. The book provides different windows into how children may explore in everyday practice settings in kindergarten, and contributes to a loci-based, ecological, integral knowledge relevant for early childhood education.",188.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5HTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5HTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=74&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r5HTDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-r5HTDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
India's Undernourished Children,Unknown,"""The prevalence of child undernutrition in India is among the highest in the world, nearly double that of Sub-Saharan Africa, with dire consequences for morbidity, mortality, productivity and economic growth. Drawing on qualitative studies and quantitative evidence from large household surveys, this book explores the dimensions of child undernutrition in India and examines the effectiveness of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)program, India's main early child development intervention, in addressing it. Although levels of undernutrition in India declined modestly during the 1990s, the reductions lagged behind those achieved by other countries with similar economic growth. Nutritional inequalities across different states and socioeconomic and demographic groups remain large. Although the ICDS program appears to be well-designed and well-placed to address the multi-dimensional causes of malnutrition in India, several problems exist that prevent it from reaching its potential. The book concludes with a discussion of a number of concrete actions that can be taken to bridge the gap between the policy intentions of ICDS and its actual implementation.""",148.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lec7ypBB1g4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lec7ypBB1g4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=78&source=gbs_api,A Call for Reform and Action,No link available

"Children's Attitudes, Knowledge and Behaviors Toward Animals",['Stephen R. Kellert'],"The basic objectives of this research, which involved children in the 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th grades, were to describe children's uses and perceptions of animals and to discern possible developmental stages in the evolution of attitudes toward animals. Personal interviews were conducted with 267 children from 16 public schools randomly selected from urban, small city, suburban, and rural areas of the state of Connecticut. Three major developmental stages in the evolution of children's perceptions of animals were found. The first stage, occurring from the 2nd to 5th grade, was characterized by a dramatic increase in emotional concern and general affection for animals. Since very young children were the most exploitative, harsh, and unfeeling of all children in their attitudes toward animals, environmental programs should focus on the affective realm. The transition from fifth to eighth grades witnessed the second major developmental stage--a major expansion in children's intellectual and cognitive understandings of animals. Therefore, factual learning should be emphasized at this stage.

Parental Education and Children's Schooling Outcomes,['Damien de Walque'],"""Educated parents tend to have educated children. But is intergenerational transmission of human capital more nature, more nurture, or both? De Walque uses household survey data from Rwanda that contains a large proportion of children living in households without their biological parents. The data allows him to separate genetic from environmental parental influences. The nonrandom placement of children is controlled by including the educational attainment of the absent biological parents and the type of relationship that links the children to their 'adoptive' families. The results of the analysis suggest that the nurture component of the intergenerational transmission of human capital is important for both parents, contrary to recent evidence proposed by Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) and Plug (2004). The author concludes that mothers' education had no environmental impact on children's schooling. Interestingly, mothers' education matters more for girls, while fathers' education is more important for boys. Finally, an important policy recommendation in the African context emerges from the analysis: the risk for orphans or abandoned children to lose ground in their schooling achievements is minimized if they are placed with relatives""--Abstract.",23.0,['Children'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLJ1LkRXXuYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DLJ1LkRXXuYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=172&source=gbs_api,"Is the Effect Nature, Nurture, Or Both? : Evidence from Recomposed Families in Rwanda",No link available
"Health, Experienced Support and School Performance among Children in Out-of-home care",['Rikard Tordön'],"Children in out-of-home care (OHC) have higher risks for developing poorer health and school achievement, being subjected to more abuse experiences, as well as negative long-term outcomes related to occupational performance, socioeconomic status, addiction, and criminality. Research related to OHC children is fragmented and the effects of interventions are under-studied. This thesis aimed to explore health, abuse, support, and preconditions for school among children in OHC and to assess changes after an intervention targeting foster children’s school performance. Paper I compared OHC pupils in last year high school to non-OHC peers in a national survey with 5 839 pupils. The study showed that risks of abuse and poor mental health are evident for adolescents in out-of-home care. Also, results indicated a lower disclosure rate of sexual abuse, particularly to police or social services. Paper II compared OHC pupils to peers in birth parent care by analyzing responses in four consecutive year surveys in a regional sample comprising 23 798 pupils in 8th-year compulsory and 2nd-year high school. Responses from the 311 pupils in OHC showed poorer outcomes than did birth-parent care peers in perceived satisfaction with social life and relations, trust to other persons in different relations, abuse experiences online, and sense of security in the school and at home. These results also applied when compared to a subset of pupils living with a single birth parent. Paper III analyzed prospective test and questionnaire data of intelligence, adaptive behavior, mathematics, literacy skills, and psychosocial wellbeing from 856 children in foster care. Results revealed poorer preconditions for school performance of between 0.5 and 1.0 standard deviations below age-standardized norms. The analysis also provided results regarding different intelligence domains, where working memory showed the lowest scores while perceptual functioning were close to norms. Boys generally scored poorer than girls except in mathematics. Paper IV explored the effects of a school-based intervention, Skolfam, on a subset of Paper III cohort (n= 475). Results showed improved skills in higher-order cognitive executive functions such as reading comprehension, sentence chains, mathematics, and intelligence. For less complex cognitive functions, affective functioning or psychosocial symptoms, no improvements were seen, except for reduced hyperactivity. Conclusion: The studies confirm that children in OHC have poorer mental health, are less satisfied with social life, have more adverse experiences both online and in real life and have poorer preconditions for school performance than do non-OHC peers. Importantly, Skolfam intervention can partially enhance preconditions for school performance. Further studies on longitudinal risk, with a design to identify specific protective factors, development of school-related competencies and ways to support OHC children in school are needed. Barn i social heldygnsvård har som grupp högre risker för att utveckla sämre hälsa och skolresultat, vara mer utsatta för övergrepp samt ha sämre långtidsutsikter relaterat till arbetsmarknad, socioekonomisk status, drogberoende och kriminalitet. Forskning om barn i social heldygnsvård är ofta fragmenterad och effekter av olika interventioner är sparsamt utvärderade. Syftet med avhandlingen var att utforska hälsa, stöd, övergrepp och förutsättningar för skola för barn i social heldygnsvård, samt att bedöma hur förutsättningar för skolprestation förändras genom en intervention som inriktas mot skolresultat för barn i familjehem. Artikel I jämförde samhällsvårdade studenter i tredje året på gymnasiet med icke samhällsvårdade jämnåriga studenter. 5 839 elever besvarade en nationell enkät. Resultatet visade att risker för övergrepp och sämre psykisk hälsa var mer frekvent för ungdomar i samhällsvård. Dessutom var andelen som berättar om övergrepp lägre bland de samhällsvårdade ungdomarna, i synnerhet till polis och socialtjänst. Artikel II jämförde samhällsvårdade elever med jämnåriga som bor med föräldrar, genom att analysera svaren från fyra på varandra följande års enkäter i ett regionalt urval som omfattade 23 798 elever från grundskolans åttonde och gymnasieskolans andra år. Svaren från de 311 eleverna i samhällsvård visade sämre utfall än icke samhällsvårdade i upplevd tillfredsställelse med socialt liv och relationer, tillit till andra personer i olika relationer, erfarenhet av nätövergrepp, samt upplevd säkerhet såväl i skolan som i hemmet, även i jämförelse med en undergrupp av studenter som bor med bara en förälder. Artikel III analyserade test- och formulärdata av intelligens, adaptivt beteende, matematik, läsfärdigheter och psykosocialt mående av 856 barn i familjehem. Resultaten visade sämre förutsättningar för skolprestation mellan 0.5 och 1.0 standardavvikelser under åldersstandardiserade normer. I analysen från olika domäner av intelligens, visade arbetsminne de lägsta resultaten, medan perceptuell funktion visade sig ligga nära medelvärdet från normeringsstudier. Pojkar hade generellt lägre poäng än flickor, förutom i matematik. Artikel IV undersökte effekter av en skolbaserad intervention, från ett antal elever från Skolfam kohorten (n = 475). Resultaten visade förbättrade färdigheter i högre exekutiva funktioner som läsförståelse, meningskedjor, matematik, samt intelligens efter intervention. För mindre komplexa kognitiva funktioner, affektiv funktion eller psykosomatiska symptom noterades inga förändringar, med undantag för lägre hyperaktivitet. Slutsatserna från dessa studier bekräftar bilden av att barn i samhällsvård har sämre psykisk hälsa, är mindre tillfreds med sitt sociala liv, har mer erfarenheter av övergrepp såväl på nätet som i verkliga livet och har sämre förutsättningar för skolresultat än sina icke samhällsvårdade jämnåriga. Ett viktigt bidrag är att interventionen Skolfam till del kan stärka förutsättningar för bättre skolprestation. Fortsatta studier av longitudinella risker, med möjlighet att identifiera specifika skyddsfaktorer, modeller för att utveckla skolrelaterade kompetenser och sätt att ytterligare stödja barn i samhällsvård behövs.",88.0,['Electronic books'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JqviDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JqviDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=178&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JqviDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JqviDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Children and Youth in Crisis,"['Mattias Lundberg', 'Alice Wuermli']","The successful development of children and young people requires that we protect and nurture a set of interrelated physiological, cognitive, and socio-emotional systems. What happens to these systems in early life can have long-term consequences and can even carry over to the next generation. The impact of economic crises on human development is similarly complex and heterogeneous. Some families and some young people display astonishing resilience – either by being comparatively unscathed by crises or by their ability to recover quickly and healthily. Other families and individuals may be unable to prevent exposure, unable to protect themselves, or may not have the same capacity to adapt positively when exposed to a crisis, with potentially serious long-term consequences for healthy development. Human development lies at the intersections of neurology and sociology, genetics and psychology, biology and economics; and this volume approaches the study of shocks and human development from a variety of disciplinary perspectives: economics, sociology, anthropology, and social and developmental psychology. This volume describes the impact of aggregate shocks on human development, and the subtle and intricate settings and pathways through which individuals can be affected. Depending on the timing, duration, transmission mechanisms, and context, the consequences for children's physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development may be costly and irreversible. Fortunately, although children suffer in adversity, they can also benefit positively when exposed to enriching environments. We need to develop and implement effective interventions to prevent the worst consequences of exposure to shocks, and to assist families and young people to recover. This volume explores what we know about protecting young people from lasting harm and promoting healthy development through a crisis. This volume is intended for policymakers, civil society, and others engaged in promoting and protecting human development and in designing and implementing safety nets during crisis. This is a novel approach as it incorporates the experiences from such diverse disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions that define human development.",319.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4bcQRTn_0VoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4bcQRTn_0VoC&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=192&source=gbs_api,Protecting and Promoting Human Development in Times of Economic Shocks,No link available

More than ever, children's health is at risk from a changing environment. The health effects of environmental risk factors - inadequate water and sanitation, unsafe home and recreational environments, lack of spatial planning for physical activity, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and hazardous chemicals - are amplified by recent developments such as financial constraints, broader socioeconomic and gender inequalities and more frequent extreme climate events.

Characteristics of Children's Early Care and Education Programs,"['Sandra L. Hofferth', 'National Center for Education Statistics']","Drawing on data from the 1995 National Household Education Survey, this report examines the characteristics of the care and education children receive on a regular basis before they enter school. The report focuses on various characteristics of child care arrangements categorized into two groups: those that have been associated with children's development and those that stem from parental concerns other than child development, such as family budget or work schedules. Following an introduction detailing data sources and limitations and what characteristics of child and family and of non-parental care are of interest, the report presents factors and findings in the following areas: (1) what were children's experiences in non-parental care in 1995; (2) what factors were associated with the types and characteristics of the child care arrangements that parents chose; (3) what were parents' sources of information and preferences regarding child care arrangements; (4) what were parents' preferences related to the attributes of the child care arrangements they selected; and (5) what were parents' preferences related to the types of arrangements they selected. The final section of the report provides a summary and conclusions. Among the findings highlighted are the following: (1) compared with children who did not have various characteristics associated with school failure, children who had these characteristics spent more time in nonparental care and were more likely to be in multiple care arrangements; (2) parents valued having their children cared for by a trained provider and with a small number of children, cost of child care was almost as important as the number children cared for; (3) a variety of other child care characteristics were related to parents' choices, including distance between home and care, whether sick child care was available, and whether English was spoken most of the time; and (4) inconsistent relationships were found between cost of care and characteristics associated with positive child outcomes.

Fire and children,"['Jeanne Humphrey Block', 'Jack Block', 'William S.

The relationships of particular personality characteristics of the children and the socialization techniques and teaching strategies of the mothers to the children's perceived attitudes about and observed performances with fire materials were determined. The findings suggest that fire play in very young children is common--more a function of curious, exploratory play than a function of psychologically driven, psychopathological behavior as might be true of fire-setting by older children. Similarities were found between personality characteristics of children with high accident rates and those showing a keen interest in fire.

Family reunification for refugee and migrant children,"['Florence Boreil', 'Ellen Desmet', 'Georgia Dimitropoulo', 'Mark Klaassen']","A practical guide to assist legislators and legal practitioners in facilitating the reunification of refugee and migrant children with their families As a result of the sharp increase in the refugee and migrant population in recent years, many children and their families have experienced family separation. Member states are bound by various obligations related to family reunification, and the practical reunification of refugee and migrant children with their family members has proved complex. This handbook is a practical guide both to key legal standards and to promising practices in the field of family reunification and restoring family links. This publication is conceived as a point of reference for capacity-building material, technical assistance, co-operation projects and new practices for and with relevant authorities and institutions.

Post-Socialist Translation Practices,['Nike K.

Based on extensive archival research in the archives of the Communist Party and on the interviews with translators and editors of the period the book attempts to outline the typical and defining features of the Socialist translatorial behaviour by re-reading more than 200 translations of children's literature and juvenile fiction published in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Despite the variety of different forms of censorship that the translators in all Socialist states were subject to, the book argues that Socialist translation in different cultural and linguistic environments, especially where the Soviet model tried to impose itself, purged the translated texts of the same or similar elements, in particular of the religious presence. The book also traces how ideologically manipulated translations are still uncritically reprinted and widely circulated today.",198.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HFJ186bmGYgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HFJ186bmGYgC&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=317&source=gbs_api,Ideological struggle in children's literature,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HFJ186bmGYgC&rdid=book-HFJ186bmGYgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Encountering Evolution,['Johanna Frejd'],"This thesis explores preschool class children’s meaning making processes when they encounter evolution. By adopting social semiotic and sociocultural perspectives on meaning making, three group-based tasks were designed. Video data from the activities were analysed using a multimodal approach. The analysis focuses on how the communicated science content affects the science focus of the tasks, how different materials function as semiotic resources and influence meaning making, and interactive aspects of doing science in the meaning-making processes. The findings reveal that, by using the provided materials and their previous experiences, the children argue for different reasons for animal diversity and evolution. Throughout the tasks, a child-centric view of life emerged in a salient manner. This means that, apart from the science focus, the children also emphasise other aspects that they find important. The child-centric perspective is suggested to be a strength that enables children to engage in science activities. The results show that the provided materials had three functions. Children use materials as resources providing meaning. This means that the children draw on the meaning potential of the materials, a process that is influenced by their previous experiences. Moreover, in interaction with peers, the materials also serve as communicative and argumentative tools. Thus, access to materials influences the children’s meaning making and enables them to discuss evolution and “do science”. The findings also reveal an intimate relationship between task context and interaction. More scripted tasks convey more child–adult interaction (scaffolding) while less scripted tasks, during which children build on previous experiences instead of communicated science content, stimulates child–child interaction (mutual collaboration). In scaffolding interactions, a greater emphasis is placed on the science topic of the task due to guidance from the adult. Consequently, meanings made by children in more scripted tasks are more likely to be “scientifically correct”. However, if the teacher or the adult steps back and allows the children to engage in mutual collaboration, they engage in multiple ways of doing science through evaluating, observing, describing and comparing. Overall, the research reported in this thesis suggests that task contexts and materials have a great impact on children’s meaning making and how science is done. Den här avhandlingen utforskar förskolebarns meningsskapandeprocesser kring evolution. Tre gruppbaserade aktiviteter har designats. Videodata har analyserats utifrån ett multimodalt perspektiv på kommunikation. Analysen fokuserar på hur kommunicerade naturvetenskapliga beskrivningar av evolution påverkar aktiviteternas naturvetenskapliga fokus, materials funktion som semiotiska resurser och påverkan på meningsskapande och interaktiva aspekter av att göra naturvetenskap. Avhandlingens resultat visar att barnen, genom att använda material och sina tidigare erfarenheter, för olika resonemang kring varför djur utvecklas och blir olika. Genomgående har barnens syn på världen en betydande roll för meningsskapandeprocessen. Det betyder att barnen, förutom att fokusera på det naturvetenskapliga innehållet i aktiviteterna, också lägger stor vikt vid andra aspekter som är viktiga för dem. Det barncentrerade perspektivet förslås vara en styrka som möjliggör för barn att delta i och engageras av naturvetenskapliga aktiviteter. De material som barnen har tillgång till de i de olika aktiviteterna har tre funktioner. Barnen använder material som meningsgivande resurser, vilket betyder att barnen använder materialens meningspotential. Denna process påverkas av barnens tidigare erfarenheter. Vidare används materialen som kommunikativa- och argumentativa redskap i interaktion med andra. Tillgången till material påverkar således barnens meningsskapande och möjliggör att de kan diskutera evolution påverkar barnens naturvetenskapliga handlande. Avhandlingens resultat visar på en nära relation mellan uppgifters kontext och interaktion. Mer styrda aktiviteter medför mer interaktion mellan barn och vuxna (scaffolding). Mindre styrda aktiviteter, där barnen bygger på sina tidigare erfarenheter, stimulerar istället interaktion mellan barnen (mutual collaboration). Som ett resultat av den vuxnes agerande, läggs det större vikt vid det naturvetenskapliga innehållet (evolution) i scaffolding-interaktioner. Följaktligen är de meningar som skapas i mer styrda aktiviteter mer i linje med naturvetenskapliga förklaringar till evolution. Samtidigt finns det ett samband mellan att den vuxne kliver åt sidan och att barnen kliver fram och gör naturvetenskapliga handlingar som att utvärdera, observera, beskriva och jämföra. Sammanfattningsvis visar den här avhandlingen att uppgifters kontext och material har stor påverkan på barns meningsskapande och hur de gör naturvetenskap.",122.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YDauDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YDauDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=345&source=gbs_api,Children's Meaning-Making Processes in Collaborative Interactions,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YDauDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YDauDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Meaning-Making for Living,['Koji Komatsu'],"This Open Access Brief analyzes the dynamics in which children’s selves emerge through their everyday activities of meaning construction, both in their relationships with family and within school education. It begins with a discussion of new psychological inquiries into children's selves and builds upon the innovative theoretical notion of the Presentational Self, developed by the author over the last decade. The book illustrates how the observation of children’s meaning construction in their everyday lives becomes a starting point for theoretical and empirical inquiries into child development and gives a framework that promotes new inquiries in this area. The book describes the Presentational Self Theory as a sense of how the notion of the Self is being worked upon in everyday life encounters.

Early Child Development from Measurement to Action,"['Mary E. Young', 'Linda M. Richardson']","Prosperity in the world today depends on societies' nurturing of young children. Quality care (stimulation, health, and nutrition) during ages 0 - 5 has a decisive and long-lasting impact on a person's development, ability to learn, and capacity to regulate emotions. Cognitive and noncognitive (social and emotional) skills, set early in life, determine later success. New research in neurobiology and the behavioral and social sciences is converging to enhance this understanding of early child development. Recently, researchers noted epigenetic effects in brain development - that is, the interaction of environment (early experiences) with genetics to shape brain structure and function - that with proper nurturing would enable people to have competence to create prosperous, sustainable, tolerant, nonviolent, and democratic communities. The World Bank recently hosted a symposium on the priority of early child development for economic growth and equity. The participants urged application of population - based tools and measures to assess the outcomes of children's early years and children's readiness for school. This approach, which shifts the focus from measures of disease, dysfunction, and mortality, is already yielding essential data for designing intervention programs, identifying children at risk, and leveraging policy and investment - to improve the possibilities for all children globally.",326.0,['Psychology'],4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cwa0LZOkv3MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Cwa0LZOkv3MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Children&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=564&source=gbs_api,A Priority for Growth and Equity,No link available

What’s France got to do with it?,['Juliana de Nooy'],"While only one book-length memoir recounting the sojourn of an Australian in France was published in the 1990s, well over 40 have been published since 2000, overwhelmingly written by women. Although we might expect a focus on travel, intercultural adjustment and communication in these texts, this is the case only in a minority of accounts. More frequently, France serves as a backdrop to a project of self-renovation in which transplantation to another country is incidental, hence the question ‘What’s France got to do with it?’ The book delves into what France represents in the various narratives, its role in the self-transformation, and the reasons for the seemingly insatiable demand among readers and publishers for these stories. It asks why these memoirs have gained such traction among Australian women at the dawn of the twenty-first century and what is at stake in the fascination with France.",217.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L576DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L576DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=9&source=gbs_api,Contemporary memoirs of Australians in France,No link available

At Home in Exile,['Helga M Griffin'],"This is a story of a girl’s construction of her identity, and of her family’s search for a place in the world, for the Heimat that is so resonant for those of German background. We follow Helga through an adventurous childhood in Iran, whose vast open spaces her mother called ‘my spiritual home’. Her engineer father worked on a grand scale, designing and laying roads and railways, and tunnelling through mountain ranges. Then came the invasions of World War II, and the family, half-German, half-Austrian, found themselves on a long voyage to Australia, designated enemy aliens. They were interned for nearly five years in the dusty Victorian countryside. On their release at the end of the War, stranded in Melbourne, they sought another home. The children were dispatched to convents, and at the Academy of Mary Immaculate, Helga found a temporary homeland, in faith. Everyday life in the Australia of the late 1940s and early 1950s is freshly seen by this feisty, loving migrant family. Through their eyes, we encounter a strange place, Australia, as if for the first time. Helga’s development from a thoughtful, sensitive child to a self-possessed young woman, wrestling with her faith and with how to live a decent life, is vividly recounted.",280.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XMkfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XMkfEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=25&source=gbs_api,A Memoir,No link available

Aural History,['Gila Ashtor'],"Aural History is an anti-memoir memoir of encountering devastating grief that uses experimental storytelling to recreate the winding, fractured path of loss and transformation. Written by a thirty-something psychotherapist and queer theorist, Aural History is structured as a sequence of three sections that each use different narrative styles to represent a distinctive stage in the protagonist's evolving relationship to trauma. Aural History explores how a cascade of self-dissolving losses crisscrosses a girl's coming of age. Through lyric prose, the first section follows a precocious tomboy whose fierce attachment to her father forces her, when he dies and she is twelve years old, to run the family bakery business, raise a delinquent younger brother, and take care of a destructive, volatile mother. In part two, scenes narrated in the third person illustrate a high-achieving high school student who is articulate and in control except for bouts of sudden and inchoate attractions, the first of which is to her severe and coaxing English teacher. The third story tells of her relation with a riveting, world-famous professor, interspersed with a tragic-comic series of dialogues between the protagonist and a cast of diverse psychotherapists as she, now twenty-five years old and living in New York City, undertakes an odyssey to understand why true self-knowledge remains elusive and her real feelings, choked and incomplete. In what Phillip Lopate calls ""an amazing document,"" Aural History pushes the narrative conventions of memoir to capture a story the genre of memoir usually struggles to tell: that you can lose yourself, and have no way to know it. Gila Ashtor is a critical theorist, writer and psychoanalyst based in New York City. She graduated with an MA in Literature and Philosophy from the University of Chicago and a PhD in Literature from Tufts University in 2016. Her research specializations include queer theory, psychoanalysis, trauma, affect studies and pedagogy. Her academic writing focuses on the relationship between queer theory and psychoanalysis and is the subject of her forthcoming book, Homo Psyche: Queer Theory and Metapsychology. Her clinical writing is primarily oriented to post-Freudian technique and theory and specifically explores the metapsychology of Jean Laplanche in the context of affect and sexuality studies. She is an Editor of Studies in Gender and Sexuality and is completing her MFA in Nonfiction at Columbia University. Currently, she is a psychoanalyst at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training & Research (IPTAR) in New York City, where she treats adults and children.",325.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vgWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vgWVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=33&source=gbs_api,,No link available

A Tiger Remembers,['Ann Wee'],"Born in the Year of the Fire Tiger, Ann Wee moved to Singapore in 1950 to marry into a Singaporean Chinese family. One of Singapore’s pioneering social work educators, Ann shares her experiences frankly and with great humour. She remembers the things that history books leave out: questions of hygiene, the emotional nuance in social relations, stories of ghost wives and changeling babies, rural clan settlements and migrant dormitories, what was lost and gained when families moved into HDB estates. Affectionately observed and wittily narrated, with a deep appreciation of how far Singapore has changed, this book brings to life the country’s social transformation by talking about the family, “in its 101 different shapes and sizes, with its capacity to cope which ranges from truly marvellous to distinctly tatty: still, in one form or another, the best place for most of us to be”.",26.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IA0KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IA0KDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=160&source=gbs_api,The Way We Were in Singapore,No link available

Rough Notes to Erasure,['Dolsy Smith'],"We are living through the wrack of the White Male. As the compact between social hierarchy, inherited privilege, and race (reinforced by gender and other normative categories) shows signs of buckling, his rage and resentment threaten us all. For he is a thing possessed: possessed by his own love of possession, and born to a sense that the world belongs to him and him alone. The spoils of oppression lie coiled inside him, a glut he can't digest, and murder beckons behind the respect that he conceives of as his due."" A hybrid of critical essay and memoir, and Rough Notes to Erasure contributes to a growing body of work that wrestles with the tacit and embodied nature of privilege and prejudice, and it contributes not only via argument but also through style. Taking inspiration from feminist/queer poetics and what Fred Moten calls “the black avant-garde,” these rough notes address the remainder that gets lost in explicit argument, which is the flesh. Where privilege roils through history, and empire whets the appetites. But also where the world catches on its own fractalization by thought, feeling, and desire; and language recovers, for a moment or two, the power to entangle us with our mother tongue.",331.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ygWVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ygWVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=168&source=gbs_api,"White Male Privilege, My Senses, and the Story I Cannot Tell",No link available

Defence Policy-Making,['Arthur Tange'],"Sir Arthur Tange was perhaps the most powerful Secretary of the Australian Defence Department and one of the most powerful of the great 'mandarins' who dominated the Commonwealth Public Service between the 1940s and the 1970s. His strong, and often decisive, influence on both administration and policy was exerted by virtue of his intellectual capacity, his administrative ability and the sheer force of his personality. Controversies from his time in Defence, including those associated with 'the Tange report' and 'the Tange reforms', echo to this day, and it is still easy to identify both staunch admirers and vitriolic critics in defence and public service circles. Tange wrote this account in his last years. It is a memoir - based largely on memory supplemented by limited reference to documentary material - that focuses upon his career after he came to Defence in 1970. It records his own account of his part in those administrative reforms and policy shifts, as well as his involvement-or non-involvement or alleged involvement-in several of the political crises of the 1970s, including the downfall of John Gorton as Prime Minister and the dismissal of the Whitlam Government.",164.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iXYCuInh6g4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iXYCuInh6g4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=178&source=gbs_api,"A Close-Up View, 1950-1980",No link available

The Fires of Israel,"['Rabbi Israel Dov Odesser o.b.m.', 'Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser o.b.m.', 'Saba Yisroel']","HH This is a book of the memoirs of Rabbi Yisroel Dov Odesser o.b.m, known affectionately as Saba Yisroel, who passed away not so long ago, almost hundred years old. In his lifetime the world went through a tremendous metamorphosis, famine and war plagued the world from the outside, and from the inside reigned all types of servitude and social injustice. Even any personal recounting of these huge upheavals would be fascinating, but Saba Yisroel takes things to an altogether different paradigm, sharing with the reader his passionate heart which didn't take the affairs lying down, but confronted his fate head on, with unfathomable courage. Saba recounts what he suffered and endured, and what he merited to learn in his very blood, life lessons which are impossible to impart except by keenly experiencing them first hand or by very strong connected association - to really empathize, feel, and relate to those that ran the gamut - and this is what Saba affords the reader - a chance to really connect with him, and with this the reader is empowered and emboldened to rise up and surmount the challenges of life, the constraints that wish to shackle him and keep him GF unaccomplished in small minded consciousness at best - or utterly devastate and pull him down to the lowest behavior and being. Saba Yisroel gives renewed hope to persevere, to hold out, to build the desire and the working to eventually really pull through and make it to the top. Saba Yisroel's went through the most trying pressures and challenges, just to stay loyal to the truth he had found and was searching for, always praying, trying, seeking with all his might to get every closer, to the eternal tachlis - ultimate purpose. These transcripts were said over to people who were no strangers to the issues at hand, they were Breslover Chasidim who understood a little the colossal obstacles and impediments that most people don't even consider surmountable, and thus Saba was able to go a little more in depth, a shade more of nuance and expression, to give them to understand what it is a person must undergo and how much tenacity and resolution is needed to master oneself and the life he is given. Along the way Saba Yisroel shares the most remarkable memories of events and holy special people of those times of yore. Saba Yisroel merited to completely abnegate himself to the holy tzaddik Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, and the entire tradition of Breslov was passed down to him, and he is the vital key transmitter of the traditions of Breslov to our generation and all future generation. Saba received the legacy in the direct link of primary disciples, generation after generation directly from Rabbi Nachman, and in addition he collected everything that was possible to be gleaned from other disciples, hearing it from them first hand in the most personal manner. Saba was not just a repository of information, but the living epitome of the values and aspirations of a true follower of Rabbi Nachman. Today, if one really desires to know what it means to be a true adherent to the holy ways, remedies, and directives of Rabbi Nachman one must turn to Saba Yisroel, to see what it's all about, and to get the correct understanding, direction, and guidance, and to get the urgent encouragement which is essential and critical especially for one who has entered and has taken up the task of living the truth, happiness, and holiness of Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman! In addition this book includes the entire booklet of: Rabbi Nachman of Breslov; Who He Was and What He Said, which gives over close to 100 important teachings of Rabbi Nachman to get a better picture of what Breslov is about. It also contains the most user friendly and accurate transliteration of the Tikun Haklali - the general/comprehensive rectification which Rabbi Nachman revealed and is known and established to do its part.

Navigating the Course,['David Fanshel'],"David Fanshel's memoir of his childhood in the Bronx during the Great Depression, and his years training and serving as a navigator in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II is an illuminating narrative of major events in the first half of the 20th Century. At the same time, the dynamics inherent in growing up in a large immigrant family is a story of ongoing relevance for individuals of all backgrounds even to the present day. David Fanshel was born in New York City in 1923, the third child of Russian Jewish parents. As a teenager in the midst of the Depression, David watched his father struggle to support the family. When tragedy struck in 1936, the network of extended relatives saved the family from disaster, but could not spare them from the stresses of their circumstances, which had significant ramifications for the younger generation. When war was declared in December 1941, David, a freshman at the City College of New York, enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps, and served three years active duty from 1943 until 1945. He was commissioned as a navigator and flew 39 missions with the 15th Air Force 450th Bomb Group, 722nd Squadron, in Manduria, Italy, a tour of duty with a very low survival rate. The only Jewish member in an air crew of ten men, the shared experiences in meeting the demands of combat had a transforming influence upon him to expand my view of the world and my place within the human stream.",,['Biography & Autobiography'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SXRXjNyHklgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SXRXjNyHklgC&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=207&source=gbs_api,A Man's Place in His Time,No link available

Wet Earth and Dreams,['Jane Lazarre'],"""In the spring of 1995, the condition I seem to have been waiting for all my life finally struck me."" So begins Jane Lazarre's account of her transforming battle with breast cancer. Following in the tradition of her critically acclaimed literary memoirs The Mother Knot and Beyond the Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons, Lazarre brilliantly interweaves her experience of life-threatening illness with other stories of recent and past losses--most notably, that of her mother to breast cancer when Jane was a small child. From these memories and experiences, Lazarre crafts a story that is at once intensely intimate and universally healing. As she contends with the pain and many indignities of her treatment for cancer, Lazarre realizes that successful medical treatment will only be part of her healing process. Her own illness becomes the vehicle for coming to terms with key moments of loss and grief--the death of a beloved therapist from breast cancer, her brother-in-law's death from AIDS, a traumatic disappointment in her work life, and the unresolved pain of being a motherless child. The gift of Lazarre's writing is her ability to transform her narratives of grief and loss into a story whose power to heal lies in its ability to penetrate the unconscious and give voice to the elusive truths hidden there. Through her writing, Lazarre is able to embrace grief--even her own inarticulate grief as a child--and find her way through the story to a restored sense of wholeness. In Wet Earth and Dreams Jane Lazarre once again proves herself to be both companion and guide through some of the most difficult challenges life has to offer. As always, she draws strength not only from sustaining friendship and love, but also from her own faith in the power of storytelling to make bearable the seemingly unbearable. Lazarre's bravely and beautifully written account of grief, illness, and death is at the last a celebration of the redemptive possibilities of the creative spirit.",144.0,['Self-Help'],3.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tfnaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tfnaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=217&source=gbs_api,A Narrative of Grief and Recovery,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfnaAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-tfnaAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Stranger To Myself,['MD Sharif Uddin '],"From the Preface The sacrifices of migrant workers are written in every inch of Singapore – in the bricks of buildings, ship irons, under the floor of houses. Thousands of years later, someone may hear the story of our pain and sacrifice from the walls of this city. After about a decade here, I have many stories and recollections to share with you. This diary contains the collected fragments of my experiences. It is not my intention to write anything against my homeland or this country. No hurt feelings, please. I have just written down the most valuable moments of my life here. This diary records observations from my reality. From the Foreword by Gwee Li Sui The records from hours between 2008 and 2016 take us on a harsh, profoundly emotional journey. Let us remember that we are meeting a passage of real life that runs concurrent to ours within this alleged city of dreams.

Something More Splendid Than Two,['José Rivers Alfaro'],"Blending literary analysis and memoir, Something More Splendid Than Two is at once an excavation of intergenerational wounds, a dance number, a poem, and a fraught love letter from son to father that disrupts the dominant narratives surrounding the life and myth of Joaquín Murrieta. In the Mexican American imaginary, the legend of Joaquín Murrieta has been recast to explain the wounding of Mexican American men after the 1848 border formation. In these versions, Joaquín is a vigilante hero and the patriarchal father of the Chicanx movement. Revisiting the most circulated version of the Joaquín myth, The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta written by Cherokee writer John Rollin Ridge, the first published Native American author in the US, Something More Splendid Than Two offers an alternative to these versions. Stitching together multiple tangled histories of Indigenous and Mexican woundings living in the margins of Ridge's 19th-century novel, alfaro opens a queer timeline where Chicanx and Indigenous solidarities can be imagined. By attuning to the choreographies of power and patriarchy that produced readers and writers like Ridge and the author of this book, josé rivers alfaro imagines that in that endless encounter between reader and writer, both time travel and collective healing are possible. josé rivers alfaro is an artist who teaches writing and literature. Raised in Sacramento, California, he attended Cosumnes River College, the community college where he currently works as a professor. He earned his B.A. in English Literature at San Francisco State University and his Ph.D. in English at UC Riverside, focusing on Nineteenth Century American Literature and Queer Latinx Studies. Before returning to Sacramento, he learned how to dance salsa and bachata. Since then, he continues to spend a lot of time thinking about how he can make the magic of the dance floor happen on the page.",115.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iASVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iASVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=226&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Rik's Army Career,['Rik Roots'],"Know this: I never wanted to be a soldier! People in uniforms scared me. My brothers - who were a lot older than me - scared me and they were all in the Army Cadets. I was happiest with my nose in a book, because you know where you are when someone else is describing their adventures on an Alien Planet. And yet in 1988 I, Richard Roots, accidentally collided with the British Army. There were triumphs, and there were tears. There was even some mud involved! Here is a truth: I was not a brilliant soldier - I was not as good as I now think I was. But I was, according to Major M in his final interview with me, second in the Troop rankings at the time of my departure, and he was sweet enough to write 'Exemplary' on my Discharge certificate. So I wasn't a bad soldier either. Another truth: I served for 57 days, 50 of them in basic training. Mine was not a long military career. As - 30 years later - I look back on my Army career, I can't help but believe it was an adventure that was destined to happen to me. A second puberty, if you like. I can come up with no other explanation for why I did what I did. And why I abandoned it all so quickly.",,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kMO9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kMO9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=234&source=gbs_api,In Its Full And Awful Glory,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kMO9DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kMO9DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1872. Excerpt: ... THE MAJOR'S STORY. FROM my childhood, my friends, I have been a soldier, and my earliest recollections are of the barrack and the camp; while my youth was accustomed to the field and the bivouac. In fact, I have been that much-maligned personage, a soldier of fortune; which means, in most cases, a soldier of no fortune at all. Once in my life I resolved to relinquish the profession of arms, and to adopt some peaceful calling; but inexorable fate drove me back to the career which I began, as I have said, almost in childhood. After having given my sword to several European powers, and also lent it to the Turk, without finding myself any better off than when I began, I determined to visit the land of promise to all adventurers like myself, and came to this country to seek a home and a family. I had always been a dreamer, and to acquire these blessings was the dearest wish of my heart; while the hope of its realization had been my only solace in many a dreary bivouac, as I lay on the ground covered with my cloak, gazing upward at the stars, with oftentimes many a poor fellow stark and stiff in his gore.around me. The expenses of the voyage had absorbed all the little ready money I possessed; and I landed in New York penniless, having nothing but a stout heart and strong limbs, that had so often stood me in good stead. It was the autumnal season; and I strolled all day through the busy streets of the great metropolis of the Western World, studying the new scenes that met my eye; and, as the shades of evening fell, I stretched myself on a bench in Washington Square to rest. I did not fear observation; for I was utterly unknown.

Persons of Interest,"['Pamela Burton', 'Meredith Edwards']","A world in upheaval; two lives lived under stress … This story is set in the social and political landscape of pre– and post–World War II. It tells two vastly different tales of Cecily and John’s lives in Australia and overseas, as nations clashed, and governments and international organisations tried to remake the world. Cecily Nixon knew that marrying John Burton would be bad for her. But she loved him and, impressed with this handsome, sullen young man and his belief that he could change the world for the better, saw her role in life as to serve the world through John. Cecily’s story is a deeply personal and psychological one of love, duty and betrayal that explores the complexities of relationships. In a world that overwhelmed her, Cecily searched for ‘wholeness’ and delved deep into her psyche to find herself and emerge from John’s shadow. John has been known as an influential and controversial young head of Australia’s Department of External Affairs – and as a would-be politician. It is less known that he was also an innovative farmer, bookseller, entrepreneur, arts patron and writer. He received international acclaim for his later work in conflict analysis and resolution.

Criminal Responsibility,['Charles Arthur Mercier'],"""Although, therefore, the subject of criminal responsibility has been considered and treated exhaustively, by Sir FitzJames Stephen, from the point of view of the professional lawyer who was in psychology an amateur, it seems that its treatment is not complete until it has been considered anew by a professional psychologist. Sir FitzJames Stephen was hampered by an insufficient knowledge of the working of the mind in health and disease. That he was so hampered he formally admits, and the admission is no disparagement to him. He made the best use of the knowledge of his time, and he obtained a singular degree of mastery over the knowledge of insanity that was then available. But in twenty years our knowledge has advanced; and I think the time is ripe to complement his work by another, written from the complementary point of view.

They include academic, professional and amateur biographers; scholars from a range of disciplines (politics, history, sociology, public administration, gender studies); and politicians who for a time strutted the political stage. The assembled papers explore the strengths and weaknesses of the biographical approach; the enjoyment it can deliver; the problems and frustrations of writing biographies; and the various ways the 'project' can be approached by those constructing these lives.

Romance of Innovation,['Anil K Rajvanshi'],"This digital book presents a brief history of renewable energy work carried out since 1981 at Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI). Too often the record of research and development (R&D) is written up as articles in journals and books. The human interest story of the way the research was done, interactions with the stakeholders and the pushes and pulls in doing it are left out of the record. This book is an attempt to record these details. It also shows how R&D can be done in a small rural institute and should provide inspiration to other NGOs who want to do a similar type of work. The aim of the book is to inspire youngsters to enter the field of rural innovations and to provide challenging ideas for research and development to those who already are converts. Dr. Rajvanshi has written in an engaging style about the romance of doing research in rural setting and has shown that with meager resources and few members of staff, very meaningful and satisfying R&D work can be done. It is often said that good R&D requires lot of equipment, money and manpower. Work on renewable energy at NARI has shown that it is possible to do good work in little money and resources”, said Dr. Rajvanshi. There are six chapters in the book, out of which five describe the hardware development work carried out in household energy (cooking and lighting); gasification; electric cycle rickshaws and water-related problems among others. The last chapter deals with the philosophical issues and hence gives a roadmap for the future development of rural India. The book is a very interesting read as it emphasizes the human interest aspect of problem solving for rural India. The future research areas described at the end of each chapter will certainly be very useful for persons who are planning to develop a career in research and development for rural areas. The book is available free of cost and is available on NARI website http://www.nariphaltan.org/roi.pdf. This book has been written in the hope that it may inspire bright engineers to be engaged in rural R&D and thus making the book available free may help in this effort.",118.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jycmBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jycmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=477&source=gbs_api,A human interest story of R&D in rural setting,No link available

Gyani Maiya,['Subhashish Panigrahi'],"Second Edition of the Datasheet booklet of the 2019 documentary film ""Gyani Maiya"", directed, written and produced by Subhashish Panigrahi. The Gi Mihaq (also known as Kusunda) used to be a semi-nomadic hunter and gatherer community that has now settled in villages around the mid-western Nepalese district of Dang. They have long lost their native language Mihaq (Kusunda), to acculturation and a lack of other means for active use. The community also lost their elder Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda in 2020, who was the most and the only known fluent Kusunda speaker. Filmed in Kulmor in the Dang District in 2018, this documentary is a memoir of Sen-Kusunda in her own words. It also serves as a biography of her people who have forgotten their language and cultural identity. Kusunda as a language was presumed to be near-extinct as there was little public knowledge of any fluent speaker after Sen-Kusunda. A few years later, the hope of hearing the language of Ban Raja (transl. “king of the forest” in Nepali, an honorific endonym by the Kusunda people.) returned because of two people: Kamala Sen Khatri, Sen-Kusunda’s younger sister who was away from Kulmor, and local researcher Uday Raj Aaley, who took Sen Khatri’s help to pilot an informal school for teaching Kusunda to local children in Kulmor. This film captures an intimate conversation between Aaley and Sen-Kusunda, who had started working together when Aaley started collecting words in Kusunda to compile a comprehensive dictionary in 2017. Aaley recognises this film to be the most detailed video documentation in Kusunda available to date under an open license.",16.0,['Performing Arts'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ocmPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ocmPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=498&source=gbs_api,2019 Documentary Datasheet,No link available
Secretaries of the Moon,"['Wallace Stevens', 'Jos e Rodr iguez Feo']","The letter from Jose Rodriguez Feo that prompted Stevens's poem was the third in a ten-year correspondence (1944-54) between the poet and the young Cuban, who quickly became Stevens's ""most exciting correspondent."" The two shared a Harvard education, both were anxious to see Stevens translated for a Cuban audience, and each had an enduring admiration for Santayana, whose awareness of the cultural tensions between the Northern and Southern hemispheres formed a basis for the protracted argument between Stevens as the practical, Protestant father and the passionate Rodriguez Feo. The Cuban's descriptions of his life at the Villa Olga, of his black-and-white cow Lucera and his mule Pompilio, delighted Stevens, as did his wide-ranging questions and pronouncements of literary matters. Unaware of the well-known Stevens reticence, Rodriguz Feo elicited a more informal, playful response than Stevens's other correspondents. Formal salutations soon gave way to ""Dear Antillean,"" ""Dear Wallachio."" Coyle and Filreis present the entire extant correspondence between the two men. The fifty-one Rodriguez Feo letters and ten of the numerous Stevens letters are printed here for the first time, and the exchange between the two is unusually complete.

Leon Abbett's New Jersey,['Richard A. Hogarty'],"Following in the succession of his 25 predecessors, Leon Abbett twice served as governor of New Jersey in the late 19nth century. A lifelong Democrat, he was a dynamic and visionary party leader who guided the citizens of New Jersey into a new urban industrial age. While he was a machine politician and party boss, he was also a notable reformer. That was a formidable combination for his time. Grappling with a series of hot political issues and braving the passions and divisions spawned by the Civil War, Abbett was one of the ablest and most intriguing men ever to be governor. Several new ideas were transformed into public policy during his tenure. Both in style and strategy, Abbett represented a sharp break from his predecessors. He was a prime example of a governor who both in crisis and in ordinary times broadened gubernatorial authority. He became both a policy and party leader. In this context, he was an important forerunner to a type of governor that had not yet appeared on the American political stage.",388.0,['Governors'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5lNFJmtpbcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=n5lNFJmtpbcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=507&source=gbs_api,The Emergence of the Modern Governor,No link available

Climbing Lessons,['Pete McDonald'],"Climbing Lessons describes the work of an instructor of outdoor pursuits from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. It is set mainly at an outdoor-education centre in Derbyshire, northern England. The book is accessible to casual, non-specialist readers as well as to outdoor professionals. It presents outdoor education in plain English. Climbing Lessons gives one person’s perspective. It covers one period. Its style differs sharply and deliberately from that of academic works on outdoor education. The author turned somersaults to avoid the jargon of education. One tertiary lecturer remarked: ‘I made use of one of the chapters in a new unit ... I was struck by how accurately it reflects the reality of working in an outdoor centre … ’ Page size: A5 Covers: Softback Number of pages: 384 About: Outdoor Education, Outdoor Leadership, Rockclimbing, Caving, Walking, Derbyshire.",396.0,['Sports & Recreation'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MrASVsqc3cEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MrASVsqc3cEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoir+%26+Autobiography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=512&source=gbs_api,Inside Outdoor Education,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MrASVsqc3cEC&rdid=book-MrASVsqc3cEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 19",['Melanie Nolan'],"Volume 19 of the Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB) contains concise biographies of individuals who died between 1991 and 1995. The first of two volumes for the 1990s, it presents a colourful montage of late twentieth-century Australian life, containing the biographies of significant and representative Australians. The volume is still in the shadow of World War II with servicemen and women who enlisted young appearing, but these influences are dimming and there are now increasing numbers of non-white, non-male, non-privileged and non-straight subjects. The 680 individuals recorded in volume 19 of the ADB include Wiradjuri midwife and Ngunnawal Elder Violet Bulger; Aboriginal rights activist, poet, playwright and artist Kevin Gilbert; and Torres Strait Islander community leader and land rights campaigner Eddie Mabo. HIV/AIDS child activists Tony Lovegrove and Eve Van Grafhorst have entries, as does conductor Stuart Challender, ‘the first Australian celebrity to go public’ about his HIV/AIDS condition in 1991. The arts are, as always, well-represented, including writers Frank Hardy, Mary Durack and Nene Gare, actors Frank Thring and Leonard Teale and arts patron Ian Potter. We are beginning to see the effects of the steep rise in postwar immigration flow through to the ADB. Artist Joseph Stanislaw Ostoja-Kotkowski was born in Poland. Pilar Moreno de Otaegui, co-founded the Spanish Club of Sydney. Chinese restaurateur and community leader Ming Poon (Dick) Low migrated to Victoria in 1953. Often we have a dearth of information about the domestic lives of our subjects; politician Olive Zakharov, however, bravely disclosed at the Victorian launch of the federal government’s campaign to Stop Violence Against Women in 1993 that she was a survivor of domestic violence in her second marriage.

Clio’s Lives,"['Doug Munro', 'John G. Reid']","Including contributions from leading scholars in the field from both Australia and North America, this collection explores diverse approaches to writing the lives of historians and ways of assessing the importance of doing so. Beginning with the writing of autobiographies by historians, the volume then turns to biographical studies, both of historians whose writings were in some sense nation-defining and those who may be regarded as having had a major influence on defining the discipline of history. The final section explores elements of collective biography, linking these to the formation of historical networks. A concluding essay by Barbara Caine offers a critical appraisal of the study of historians’ biographies and autobiographies to date, and maps out likely new directions for future work. Clio’s Lives is a very good scholarly collection that advances the study of autobiography and biography within the writing of history itself, taking theoretical questions in significant new directions. The contributors are well known and highly respected in the history profession and write with an insight and intellectual energy that will ensure the book has considerable impact. They examine cutting-edge issues about the writing of history at the personal level through autobiography and biography in diverse and innovative ways. Together the writers have provided reflective chapters that will be widely read for their impressive theoretical advances as well as being inspirational for new entrants to the disciplinary area. — Patricia Grimshaw, University of Melbourne Clio’s Lives brings together a most interesting and varied cast of contributors. Its chapters contain sophisticated and well-penned ruminations on the uses of biography and autobiography among historians. These are clearly connected with the general themes of the volume.

The Copepodologist's Cabinet,['David M. Damkaer'],"Copepod crustaceans are the most numerous multicellular animals on earth. They occur in every free-living and parasitic aquatic niche. Copepods have been known since the time of Aristotle, yet there has never been a history of the study of copepods. This volume, the first in a planned three-volume series, reviews the discoveries of copepods to 1832, the year that the two distinct branches, the free-living copepods (long-known as insects) and the parasitic copepods (thought to be molluscs or worms) were finally acknowledged as members of the same Class Crustacea. The narrative includes the biographies of 90 early copepodologists and recounts their most important contributions to science. Portraits are included for two-thirds of the subjects, with considerable new material as well as information and illustrations from obscure sources. Milestones include the first description of copepods (ca. 350 B.C.), the first illustration (1554), the first free-living freshwater copepod (1688), the first explanation of a free-living copepod's metamorphosis (1756), the first permanently named copepod (1758), the first free-living marine copepod (1770), and the first description of a parasitic copepod's metamorphosis (1819). The work ends with a transition to the mid-19th century, previewing numerous personal connections that pointed toward copepodology's Golden Age in the 1890s, to be covered in Volume 2.

Agricultural Education,"['Lindsay Falvey, Robert White, Malcolm Hickey, Nigel Wood, Snow Barlow, Frank Larkins, Kwong Lee Dow, Jeff Topp, Janet Beard']","Agricultural Education remains fundamental to civilization. It is the most consistent productive income of Australia, which is one of the world’s very few net agricultural exporters. Victoria, with only about three percent of the Australia’s area, has been its major source of agricultural output. These three factors – underpinning civilization, creating wealth, and intensity in south-eastern Australia – make Victorian agriculture and its education of national importance and international significance. The Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Melbourne, at times complemented by La Trobe University and such colleges as Burnley, Dookie, Gilbert Chandler, Glenormiston, Longerenong, Marcus Oldham and McMillan, has underpinned sustained rises in productivity and profitability. But coordination and consistency have not always been its hallmarks. This history reveals that Agriculture at Melbourne began amidst controversy, grew to fame under a great Dean, at times rested on its laurels and others was dragged into organisational experiments. Its 22 Deans over its 110 years typify the calling evident in its staff. Frequently a leader, the Faculty has recently strengthened its animal sciences by joining with the veterinary sciences – but that is for a future history.",230.0,['Agricultural education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oecvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oecvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA197&dq=Biography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=411&source=gbs_api,"in Victoria & the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Melbourne",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oecvDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oecvDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"The East India Company at Home, 1757-1857","['Margot Finn', 'Kate Smith']","The East India Company at Home, 1757–1857 explores how empire in Asia shaped British country houses, their interiors and the lives of their residents. It includes chapters from researchers based in a wide range of settings such as archives and libraries, museums, heritage organisations, the community of family historians and universities. It moves beyond conventional academic narratives and makes an important contribution to ongoing debates around how empire impacted Britain. The volume focuses on the propertied families of the East India Company at the height of Company rule. From the Battle of Plassey in 1757 to the outbreak of the Indian Uprising in 1857, objects, people and wealth flowed to Britain from Asia. As men in Company service increasingly shifted their activities from trade to military expansion and political administration, a new population of civil servants, army officers, surveyors and surgeons journeyed to India to make their fortunes. These Company men and their families acquired wealth, tastes and identities in India, which travelled home with them to Britain. Their stories, the biographies of their Indian possessions and the narratives of the stately homes in Britain that came to house them, frame our explorations of imperial culture and its British legacies.",540.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dThMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dThMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA484&dq=Biography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=508&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The Life and Genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne,['Frank Preston Stearns'],"Excerpt: ...of their little red cottage, which has since unfortunately been destroyed by fire. She even began to give her daughter, who was only six years old, some instruction in drawing. The following extract concerning her husband, from a letter written to her mother, is charmingly significant of her state of mind at this time. ""Beauty and the love of it, in him, are the true culmination of the good and true, and there is no beauty to him without these bases. He has perfect dominion over himself in every respect, so that to do the highest, wisest, loveliest thing is not the least effort to him, any more than it is to a baby to be innocent. It is his spontaneous act, and a baby is not more unconscious in its innocence. I never knew such loftiness, so simply borne. I have never known him to stoop from it in the most trivial household matter, any more than in a larger or more public one."" Footnote: J. Hawthorne, i. 373. Truly this gives us a beautiful insight into their home-life, and Hawthorne himself could not have written a more accurate eulogium. As intimated in the last chapter, we all make our way through life by correcting our daily trespasses, and Hawthorne was no exception to it; but as a mental analysis of this man at his best Mrs. Hawthorne's statement deserves a lasting recognition. ""THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES"" It was not until early frosts and shortening days drove Hawthorne within doors that he again took up his writing, but who can tell how long he had been dreaming over his subject? Within five months, or by the last week of January, ""The House of the Seven Gables"" was ready for the press. There is no such house in Salem, exactly as he describes it; but an odd, antiquated-looking structure at No. 54 Turner Street is supposed to have served him for the suggestion of it. The name is picturesque and well suited to introduce the reader to a homely suburban romance. The subject of the story goes back to the witchcraft period, and its active...",498.0,"['Authors, American']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ts1aAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ts1aAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA258&dq=Biography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=538&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ts1aAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-ts1aAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Sartor Resartus,['Thomas Carlyle'],"Thomas Carlyle's ""Sartor Resartus"" was an influential novel, and partakes of the 19th century conceit of the ""found manuscript"" variety, in this case a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, with editorial asides and interjections. Teufelsdröckh has written an extensive treatise on clothes, which the editorial voice plumbs for a full measure of humor - of the extremely dry British variety. The novel contains much of the philosophy current in the early years of the Victorian Age, and the novel helps shed the light of understanding on that influential period of English history.",536.0,['Bookbinding'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7LsVvcWKbnEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7LsVvcWKbnEC&pg=PP1&dq=Biography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=561&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7LsVvcWKbnEC&rdid=book-7LsVvcWKbnEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Green Criminology,"['Bill McClanahan', 'Avi Brisman']","In the past three decades, a stream of criminological inquiry has emerged which explores, measures, and theorizes crimes and harms to the environment at the micro-, mezzo-, and macro-levels. This “green criminology”, as it has come to be known, has widened the criminological gaze to consider crimes and harms committed against air, land (from forests to wetlands), nonhuman animals, and water in local, regional, national, and international areas or arenas. Accordingly, green criminology has endeavored to understand the causes and consequences of air and water pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, corporate environmental crime (e.g., illegal waste disposal), food production and distribution, resource extraction and exploitation, and wildlife trade and trafficking, while also exploring potential responses to these issues. This book seeks to introduce the green criminological perspective to a broader social science audience. Recognizing that green criminology is not the first social science to explore the phenomena and harms at the intersections of humanity and ecology, this book offers an introduction to some of the unique insights developed over nearly 30 years of green criminological thought and scholarship to students, professors, researchers, and practitioners working in the fields of anthropology, economics, environmental humanities, environmental sociology, geography, history, and political ecology. This book contains contributions from researchers in green criminology from around the world, including early- and mid-career scholars, as well as more established voices in the field—all of whom are dedicated to exposing, understanding, and ultimately hoping to thwart further environmental degradation and despoliation.",94.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YL4rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YL4rEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=Food+%26+Drink&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=34&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Fabrication of Food Bars Based on Compression and Molding Matrices,['Robert L. Pavey'],"Dried foods, plasticized to prevent fragmentation, were compressed with appropriate binders into bars of approximately equal size, density and caloric content. Bars representing the following food items were designed, formulated, fabricated and evaluated for physical, chemical and sensory characteristics after storage for 3 months at 38C: (1) beef stew, (2) chicken and rice, (3) barbecue pork, (4) chili with beans, (5) shrimp creole, (6) chicken a la king, (7) tuna salad, (8) scrambled eggs with bacon, (9) mixed creamed vegetables and (10) apple pie filling. Complete information on all formulations and processing is supplied. In accordance with design requirements bars were rated by a taste panel as acceptable for consumption from the dry-compressed state and for consumption after rehydration for 20 minutes in water at 80C (25C for items consumed at room temperature). Bars were evaluated for cohesiveness, dimensional stability under pressure, ease of shear by the incisors and subsequent mastication. Observations on free fatty acids, peroxide value and browning (reflectance units) are recorded for each bar at the time of fabrication and after the referenced storage.

Dietary assessment,['Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations'],"FAO provides countries with technical support to conduct nutrition assessments, in particular to build the evidence base required for countries to achieve commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) and under the 2016-2025 UN Decade of Action on Nutrition. Such concrete evidence can only derive from precise and valid measures of what people eat and drink. There is a wide range of dietary assessment methods available to measure food and nutrient intakes (expressed as energy insufficiency, diet quality and food patterns etc.) in diet and nutrition surveys, in impact surveys, and in monitoring and evaluation. Differenct indicators can be selected according to a study's objectives, sample population, costs and required precision. In low capacity settings, a number of other issues should be considered (e.g. availability of food composition tables, cultural and community specific issues, such as intra-household distribution of foods and eating from shared plates, etc.). This manual aims to signpost for the users the best way to measure food and nutrient intakes and to enhance their understanding of the key features, strengths and limitations of various methods. It also highlights a number of common methodological considerations involved in the selection process. Target audience comprises of individuals (policy-makers, programme managers, educators, health professionals including dietitians and nutritionists, field workers and researchers) involved in national surveys, programme planning and monitoring and evaluation in low capacity settings, as well as those in charge of knowledge brokering for policy-making.",172.0,['Medical'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nGy1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nGy1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Food+%26+Drink&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=231&source=gbs_api,A resource guide to method selection and application in low resource settings,No link available
Climate-Smart Food,['Dave Reay'],"This open access book asks just how climate-smart our food really is. It follows an average day's worth of food and drink to see where it comes from, how far it travels, and the carbon price we all pay for it. From our breakfast tea and toast, through breaktime chocolate bar, to take-away supper, Dave Reay explores the weather extremes the worlds farmers are already dealing with, and what new threats climate change will bring. Readers will encounter heat waves and hurricanes, wildfires and deadly toxins, as well as some truly climate-smart solutions. In every case there are responses that could cut emissions while boosting resilience and livelihoods. Ultimately we are all in this together, our decisions on what food we buy and how we consume it send life-changing ripples right through the global web that is our food supply. As we face a future of 10 billion mouths to feed in a rapidly changing climate, its time to get to know our farmers and herders, our vintners and fisherfolk, a whole lot better. Dave Reay is Professor of Carbon Management at the University of Edinburgh, UK. He has studied climate change for over 20 years, from warming impacts in the Southern Ocean, through carbon fluxes in forests, to greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands and agriculture. In 2018 he received the Chancellors Award for Teaching for his work in climate change education.

"Photography in the Third Reich: Art, Physiognomy and Propaganda",['Christopher Webster'],"This lucid and comprehensive collection of essays by an international group of scholars constitutes a photo-historical survey of select photographers who embraced National Socialism during the Third Reich. These photographers developed and implemented physiognomic and ethnographic photography, and, through a Selbstgleichschaltung (a self-co-ordination with the regime), continued to practice as photographers throughout the twelve years of the Third Reich. The volume explores, through photographic reproductions and accompanying analysis, diverse aspects of photography during the Third Reich, ranging from the influence of Modernism, the qualitative effect of propaganda photography, and the utilisation of technology such as colour film, to the photograph as ideological metaphor. With an emphasis on the idealised representation of the German body and the role of physiognomy within this representation, the book examines how select photographers created and developed a visual myth of the ‘master race’ and its antitheses under the auspices of the Nationalist Socialist state. Photography in the Third Reich approaches its historical source photographs as material culture, examining their production, construction and proliferation. This detailed and informative text will be a valuable resource not only to historians studying the Third Reich, but to scholars and students of film, history of art, politics, media studies, cultural studies and holocaust studies.",310.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7N0SEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7N0SEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7N0SEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7N0SEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

EXISTING IN COSTUME,"['Chan-Hyo Bae', 'Kim Hong-hee', 'Bill Kounwenhoven']","The book covers five photography series which Chan-Hyo Bae has worked on so far, Self-Portrait, Fairy Tales, Punishment, Witch Hunting and the new series Jumping into the Oil Paintings. Each series have been divided into individual categories but the book’s editing shows that all series are above the same photographic context. As the artist had been fiercely living as a stranger in the U.K. but was unable to be absorbed and experience alienation and anger as an Asian living in Western culture, his artistic challenge to the meta discourse of Western culture became the key word of this series of work. Meanwhile, Jumping into the Oil Paintings is an extension of Existing in Costume but also a very different attempt. In terms of the formality of the work, Existing in Costume is a process that visualizes the artist's feelings of prejudice and alienation through elaborating exquisite plan and production, while Jumping into the Oil Paintings do not simply damage but deconstruct the subject's essence by gilding on the printed photography or by copying the paintings images and transfer it to animal skins. His new series could be seen as a way more aggressive challenge to the system of Western thought and through this, we might carefully gauged the direction of his future works. This photography book which contains 52 works from five series include articles of Kim Hong-hee, the art critic and the previous director of Seoul Museum of Art and also Bill Kuenhoven’s article, who has executive capacity in international photography scene since he had been worked as an editor of several major photography magazines for the past 20 years including Hotshoe Inernational.

Impressed by Light,"['Roger Taylor', 'Larry John Schaaf']","Photography emerged in 1839 in two forms simultaneously. In France, Louis Daguerre produced photographs on silvered sheets of copper, while in Great Britain, William Henry Fox Talbot put forward a method of capturing an image on ordinary writing paper treated with chemicals. Talbot’s invention, a paper negative from which any number of positive prints could be made, became the progenitor of virtually all photography carried out before the digital age. Talbot named his perfected invention ""calotype,"" a term based on the Greek word for beauty. Calotypes were characterized by a capacity for subtle tonal distinctions, massing of light and shadow, and softness of detail. In the 1840s, amateur photographers in Britain responded with enthusiasm to the challenges posed by the new medium. Their subjects were wide-ranging, including landscapes and nature studies, architecture, and portraits. Glass-negative photography, which appeared in 1851, was based on the same principles as the paper negative but yielded a sharper picture, and quickly gained popularity. Despite the rise of glass negatives in commercial photography, many gentlemen of leisure and learning continued to use paper negatives into the 1850s and 1860s. These amateurs did not seek the widespread distribution and international reputation pursued by their commercial counterparts, nearly all of whom favored glass negatives. As a result, many of these calotype works were produced in a small number of prints for friends and fellow photographers or for a family album. This richly illustrated, landmark publication tells the first full history of the calotype, embedding it in the context of Britain’s changing fortunes, intricate class structure, ever-growing industrialization, and the new spirit under Queen Victoria. Of the 118 early photographs presented here in meticulously printed plates, many have never before been published or exhibited.",456.0,['Calotype'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DnfBcmW-OkYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DnfBcmW-OkYC&pg=PP1&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=44&source=gbs_api,"British Photographs from Paper Negatives, 1840-1860",No link available
A Centennial Album,"['Nadine M. Orenstein ', 'Jeff L. Rosenheim', 'Stephen C. Pinson']","The Met’s collection of drawings, prints, and photographs is an expansive work in progress and is considered one of the nation’s greatest repositories of humanity’s creativity. This Bulletin celebrates the centennial of the founding of the Department of Prints. William M. Ivins, the visionary founding curator of the department, had an expansive view of what constituted a “work on paper”—a philosophy that informed much of The Met’s collecting over the next century. The result today is a comprehensive repository reflecting an astonishing diversity of artists, genres, and media.

The Limits of Art,['Jiri Benovsky'],"This open access book is about exploring interesting borderline cases of art. It discusses the cases of gustatory and olfactory artworks (focusing on food), proprioceptive artworks (dance, martial arts, and rock climbing qua proprioceptive experiences), intellectual artworks (philosophical and scientific theories), as well as the vague limits between painting and photography. The book focuses on the author's research about what counts as art and what does not, as well as on the nature of these limits. Overall, the author defends a very inclusive view, 'extending' the limits of art, and he argues for its virtues. Some of the limits discussed concern our senses (our different perceptual modalities), some concern vagueness and fuzzy boundaries between different types of works of art, some concern the amount of human intention and intervention in the process of creation of an artwork, and some concern the border between art and science. In these various ways, by understanding better such borderline cases, Benovsky suggests that we get a better grip on an understanding of the nature of art.--",63.0,['Aesthetics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hlj4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hlj4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=48&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hlj4DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hlj4DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Art and the Empire City,"['Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)']","Presented in conjunction with the September 2000 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, this volume presents the complex story of the proliferation of the arts in New York and the evolution of an increasingly discerning audience for those arts during the antebellum period. Thirteen essays by noted specialists bring new research and insights to bear on a broad range of subjects that offer both historical and cultural contexts and explore the city's development as a nexus for the marketing and display of art, as well as private collecting; landscape painting viewed against the background of tourism; new departures in sculpture, architecture, and printmaking; the birth of photography; New York as a fashion center; shopping for home decorations; changing styles in furniture; and the evolution of the ceramics, glass, and silver industries.

Queer and Bookish,['Jason Edwards'],"Queer and Bookish: Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick as Book Artist represents the first book-length study to explore the intersections of Sedgwick's critical writing, poetry, and, most importantly, book art, making the case that her art criticism, especially her meditations on domestic and nineteenth-century photography, and ""artist's book"" projects are as formally complex and brilliant, conceptually significant and life-changing, as her literary criticism and theory. In addition, the book represents a significant intervention into recent debates about reparative reading, surface reading, and the descriptive turn across the humanities, because of its sustained, positive accounts on Sedgwick's books as visual, textural, and material objects. The book ranges across Sedgwick's published output, from The Coherence of Gothic Conventions (1980) to the posthumously published The Weather in Proust (2011), and features her meditations on a wide variety of art-historical topoi, including Judith Scott's queer/crip fiber art; the anality of Polykleitos's Doryphorus; queer Modernist typography; Piranesi's punitive space; Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell's queer holy family; Manet's frontality and thalassic aesthetics; fat and thin aesthetics of various stripes; and the queer photography of Anna Atkins, Clementina Hawarden, and Julia Margaret Cameron; Baron De Mayer, Eugene Atget, and P.H. Emerson; as well as David Hockney, Ken Brown, and her own father, a NASA lunar photographer. The book climaxes with two chapter-length explorations of Sedgwick's own late-life book-art practice: her panda Valentine alphabet cards (c. 1996) and her Last Days of Pompeii/Cavafy unique artist's book (c. 2007). Jason Edwards is a Professor of Art History at the University of York, where he works at the intersections of queer and vegan theory, and on British art history in its global contexts in the period from c.1760-1940. He is the author of the Routledge Critical Thinkers volume on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (Routledge, 2009) as well as the editor of Bathroom Songs: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick As a Poet (punctum books, 2017), which includes Sedgwick's uncollected poems. In addition, Jason is also the author of Alfred Gilbert's Aestheticism (Ashgate 2006), and the co-editor of special issues of journals and edited collections on Grinling Gibbons, Joseph Cornell, the British School of Sculpture c.1760-1832, Victorian sculpture in its global contexts, the Arts and Crafts and Aesthetic interiors, and homoeroticism, art and aestheticism in Victorian Britain. Jason has also co-curated exhibitions on Turner's whaling imagery, Alfred Gilbert, and Victorian sculpture more broadly, at Tate Britain, the Yale Center for British Art, Hull Maritime Museum, Lotherton Hall, and the Henry Moore Institute for the Study of Sculpture, in Leeds.

Courbet and the Modern Landscape,Unknown,"With its fittingly dramatic design, Courbet and the Modern Landscape accompanies the first major museum exhibition specifically to address Gustave Courbet's extraordinary achievement in landscape painting. Many of these carefully selected works produced from 1855 to 1876--gathered from Asia, Europe, and North America--will be new to readers. The catalogue--which accompanies an exhibition at the Getty Museum to be held from February 21 to May 14, 2006--highlights the artist's expressive responses to the natural environment. Essays by the curators examine Courbet's distinctly modern practice of landscape painting. Mary Morton's essay situates his landscapes in relation to his work in other genres, his critical reputation, and his role in establishing a new pictorial language for landscape painting. Charlotte Eyerman's essay investigates how later generations of nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists responded to Courbet's example. The catalogue also includes an essay by Dominique de Font-Reaulx, curator of photographs at the Musee d'Orsay, on the relationship between Courbet's work and landscape photography of the 1850s and 1860s.

Between Stillness and Motion,['Eivind Røssaak'],"Since the development of film as an artistic medium in the 1890s, there has been an inherent tension between still photographic images and moving cinematic images, from their form and function to the messages they convey and their impact on the beholder and on culture at large. This volume, one of the first book-length works to analyze, critique, and further the international debate about the meaning and use of motion and stillness in film and photography, takes these concepts out of the theoretical arena of cinematic studies and applies them to the wider and ever-changing landscape of images and media. With contributions from such acclaimed international scholars as Tom Gunning, Thomas Elsaesser, Mark B. N. Hansen, George Baker, Ina Blom, and Christa Blümlinger, these collected essays examine the strategic uses of stillness and motion in art from the mid-nineteenth century to the technologically driven present.",245.0,['Performing Arts'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P_daNAuP5u0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P_daNAuP5u0C&pg=PA118&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=263&source=gbs_api,"Film, Photography, Algorithms",No link available

Watercolors of the Acropolis,"['Joan R. Mertens', 'Lisa Conte']","In the days before color photography, hand-colored drawings and photographs were the principal means of documenting polychrome Greek art. Beginning in the late 1870s, Émile Gilliéron recorded major archaeological discoveries in Greece shortly after their excavation. This Bulletin, accompanying an exhibition of five watercolors by Gilliéron, features the Swiss draftsman’s drawings of sculptures from the Athenian Acropolis. On view for decades after their acquisition, Gilliéron’s watercolors were eventually retired to The Met's basement, likely in the late 1940s, before the advent of modern conservation practices. Reproductions and copies fell out of fashion, and Gilliéron’s work remained in storage until 2015. In addition to telling the story of the watercolors during Gilliéron’s time, this Bulletin follows the conservators’ heroic efforts to rehabilitate these forgotten pieces. Images of the conserved watercolors, published here for the first time, provide fascinating insight into the sculptures found at the Acropolis as they appeared when they were first unearthed around the turn of the century.",52.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8QWWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8QWWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=275&source=gbs_api,Émile Gilliéron in Athens,No link available

The Arts Public in the South,Unknown,"Combining and integrating the results of two separate research projects concerned with leisure time participation, this report compared southern and non-southern involvement in arts-related activities. Findings indicated that, while some regional differences do exist, they are not great. The desire to increase arts-related activities is not as strong as the desire to increase less focused leisure activities, but there appears to be a strong unmet demand for increased opportunities to participate in arts-related programs, including both visual and performing arts. While southerners cite cost and accessibility as barriers to participation, non-southerners mention lack of time. Achieved educational levels and prior exposure to the arts are significantly related to arts participation rates. Singing in a chorus is the activity in which southerners are most clearly differentiated from the non-southern population in terms of greater participation and demand. Lack of talent was cited by southerners as a reason for non-participation in contrast to non-southerners' response of lack of training. Leisure pursuits of most southerners are not related to the type of work they do. While the best predictor of current levels of participation is prior participation, this factor was not confirmed with respect to the desire to increase participation in the future.

Combining a wide range of disciplinary approaches, methods and theories, the volume assembles over 50 contributions that explore and compare processes of religious individualisation in different religious environments and historical periods, in particular in Asia, the Mediterranean, and Europe from antiquity to the recent past. Contrary to standard theories of modernisation, which tend to regard religious individualisation as a specifically modern or early modern as well as an essentially Western or Christian phenomenon, the chapters reveal processes of religious individualisation in a large variety of non-Western and pre-modern scenarios. Furthermore, the volume challenges prevalent views that regard religions primarily as collective phenomena and provides nuanced perspectives on the appropriation of religious agency, the pluralisation of religious options, dynamics of de-traditionalisation and privatisation, the development of elaborated notions of the self, the facilitation of religious deviance, and on the notion of dividuality.",1444.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DbfNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DbfNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA620&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=293&source=gbs_api,Historical Dimensions and Comparative Perspectives,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DbfNDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-DbfNDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Education on the Aging,['Betty Arnett Ward'],"Since aging has become a field of increasing interest, many requests for information on the educational aspects of the subject have been received in the Office of Education. Because of the growing number of these requests, and because so few items bearing on education are included in the reference lists in the general field of aging, this bibliography was prepared. It should service both the broad field of adult education and the growing profession of gerontology. This bibliography is a listing of selected titles bearing directly or indirectly upon educational programs and activities designed for the primary purpose of developing skills, knowledge, habits, or attitudes appropriate and necessary for vital, purposeful living during the years of later maturity. The references are arranged in sections reflecting the influence and research interests of a wide variety of disciplines and specialties within the broad field of aging. The annotations are, for the most part, brief summary descriptions of readily accessible titles and materials which may help the reader to make selections in accordance with his own needs and with those of the older adult participant. The bibliography should be useful to social gerontologists, adult education administrators and teachers, personnel managers and placement officers, industrial training supervisors, vocational and rehabilitation counselors, museum staff personnel, and volunteers who are currently engaged in full- or part-time work with the aging. Further, it should serve the needs of librarians in the development of professional and special collections of materials for use in reading courses, or for use in displays and exhibits in connection with general training conferences, workshops, and institutes. The selected items as they relate to education should: (1) Throw light on the role of professional workers, the lay leader, the aging individual, and the officials and members of community organizations in promoting improved attitudes toward aging and the aged; (2) provide information about surveys and research studies in the field of aging and related fields; and (3) describe a variety of helpful programs which are both meeting various needs of older adults and utilizing their talents and resources for the good of the community and the Nation.

Vigée Le Brun,"['Joseph Baillio', 'Katharine Baetjer', 'Paul Lang']","Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (1755–1842) was one of the finest eighteenth-century french painters and among the most important women artists of all time. Celebrated for her expressive portraits of French royalty and aristocracy, and especially of her patron Marie Antoinette, Vigée Le Brun exemplified success and resourcefulness in an age when women were rarely allowed either. Because of her close association with the queen Vigée Le Brun was forced to flee France during the French Revolution. For twelve years she traveled throughout Europe, painting noble sitters in the courts of Naples, Russia, Austria, and Prussia. She returned to France in 1802, under the reign of Emperor Napoleon I, where her creativity continued unabated. This handsome volume details Vigée Le Brun's story, portraying a talented artist who nimbly negotiated a shifting political and geographic landscape. Essays by international scholars address the ease with which this self-taught artist worked with monarchs, the nobility, court officials and luminaries of arts and letters, many of whom attended her famous salons. The position of women artists in Europe and at the Salons of the period is also explored, as are the challenges faced by Vigée Le Brun during her exile. The ninety paintings and pastels included in this volume attest to Vigée Le Brun's superb sense of color and expression. They include exquisite depictions of counts and countesses, princes and princesses alongside mothers and children, including the artist herself and her beloved daughter, Julie. A chronology of the life of Vigée Le Brun and a map of her travels accompany the text, elucidating the peregrinations of this remarkable, independent painter.",292.0,['History'],4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YLqzCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YLqzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=331&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Cézanne in the Studio,['Carol Armstrong'],"In the last years of his life Paul Cézanne produced a stunning series of watercolors, many of them sill lifes. Still Life with Blue Pot is one of these late masterpieces that is now in the collection of the Getty Museum. In Cézanne in the Study: Still Life in Watercolors, Carol Armstrong places this great painting within the context of Cezanne’s artistic and psychological development and of the history of the genre of still life in France. Still life—like the medium of watercolor—was traditionally considered to be “low” in the hierarchy of French academic paintings. Cézanne chose to ignore this hierarchy, creating monumental still-life watercolors that contained echoes of grand landscapes and even historical paintings in the manner of Poussin—the “highest” of classical art forms. In so doing he changed his still lifes with new meanings, both in terms of his own notoriously difficult personality and in the way he used the genre to explore the very process of looking at, and creating, art. Carol Armstrong’s study is a fascinating exploration of the brilliant watercolor paintings that brought Cézanne’s career to a complex, and triumphant, conclusion, The book includes new photographic studies of the Getty’s painting that allow the reader to encounter this great watercolor as never before, in all of its richness and detail.",160.0,['Art'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZB02AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZB02AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Art+%26+Photography&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=366&source=gbs_api,Still Life in Watercolors,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZB02AgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZB02AgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Rubens & Brueghel,"['Anne T. Woollett', 'Ariane van Suchtelen']","Truly collaborative paintings, that is, not simply mechanical but also conceptual co-productions, are rare in the history of art. This gorgeously illustrated catalogue explores just such an extraordinary partnership between Antwerp's most eminent painters of the early seventeenth century, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625). Rubens and Brueghel executed approximately twenty-five works together between around 1597 and Brueghel's death in 1625. Highly prized and sought after by collectors throughout Europe, the collaborative works of Rubens and Brueghel were distinguished by an extremely high level of quality, further enhanced by the status of the artists themselves. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Getty Museum to be held July 5 to September 24, 2006, the catalogue features twenty-six color plates of such Rubens/Brueghel paintings as The Return from War, The Feast of Acheloï¿½s, and Madonna and Child in a Garland of Flowers, along with Rubens and Brueghel's collaborations with important contemporaries such as Frans Snyders and Hendrick van Balen.

Sustainability of Microfinance Self Help Groups in India,['Ajai Nair'],"The major form of microfinance in India is that based on women's Self Help Groups (SHGs), which are small groups of 10--20 members. These groups collect savings from their members and provide loans to them. However, unlike most accumulating savings and credit associations (ASCAs) found in several countries, these groups also obtain loans from banks and on-lend them to their members. By 2003, over 700,000 groups had obtained over Rs.20 billion (US$425 million) in loans from banks benefiting more than 10 million people. Delinquencies on these loans are reported to be less than 5 percent. Savings in these groups is estimated to be at least Rs.8 billion (US$170 million). Despite these considerable achievements, sustainability of the SHGs has been suspect because several essential services required by the SHGs are provided free or at a significantly subsidized cost by organizations that have developed these groups. A few promoter organizations have, however, developed federations of SHGs that provide these services and others that SHG members need, but which SHGs cannot feasibly provide. Using a case study approach, Nair explores the merits and constraints of federating. Three SHG federations that provide a wide range of services are studied. The findings suggest that federations could help SHGs become institutionally and financially sustainable because they provide the economies of scale that reduce transaction costs and make the provision of these services viable. But their sustainability is constrained by several factors--both internal, related to the federations themselves, and external, related to the other stakeholders. The author concludes by recommending some actions to address these constraints. This paper--a product of the Finance and Private Sector Development Unit, South Asia Region--is part of a larger effort in the region to study access to finance in India.",45.0,['Microfinance'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hQGAnS6EX4MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hQGAnS6EX4MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=61&source=gbs_api,Would Federating Help?,No link available

Gender-inclusive governance of “self-help” groups in rural Kenya,"['Aberman, Noora-Lisa', 'Birner, Regina', 'Odoyo, Elizabeth Auma Okiri', 'Oyunga, Mary Anyango', 'Okoba, Barrack', 'Okello, George Otiep']","There is vast literature on groups as a useful mechanism for rural development, especially for women. However, for group participation to fulfil on potential benefits to women, gender-specific constraints must be addressed. This study examines how to promote gender-inclusive governance of mixed-sex self-help groups in the African context, analysing twenty mixed-sex focus group discussions with 190 group members in rural western Kenya. Emphasizing group member perceptions and beliefs about participation and governance, we undertake an empirical assessment of institutional factors that explain and facilitate effective participation of female members. We find that group-member endowments impact the group’s interpretation in terms of their understanding of gender issues and political processes, and that the pro-gender intentions behind governance structures are more important than the structures themselves. Furthermore, groups in this context serve as a distinct parallel institution to that of the home that enable them to push the boundaries of community gender norms.",33.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-MYQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-MYQEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=71&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MYQEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book--MYQEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Self-help groups for India’s financial inclusion,"['Rajeev, Meenakshi', 'Vani, B.P.', 'Veerashekharappa']","Ensuring accessibility to credit to the poor self-employed households is a critical concern for many developing nations. Self-help groups (SHG) formed by women in the developing countries help them to access financial intermediaries and access credit for various income-generating activities. In case of India, SHGs are formed either through state-assisted SHG-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) or through private initiatives of micro finance institutions (MFIs) or NGOs. Under the former, the groups access formal banking directly while in case of MFIs, loan is disbursed through MFIs themselves. Rate of interest in case of loans obtained by SHGs through SBLP, therefore, depends on the rate of interest charged by the various types of formal lending agencies and is often found to be lower than the interest charges of the MFIs. It is, however, argued that transaction costs involved in a bank loan are substantial, therefore, borrowers prefer loans from the informal sector, delivered at the borrower’s doorstep. In order to examine this issue rigorously, we have tried to estimate the effective costs towards borrowing by including the transaction costs, estimated using quantitative data collected through our survey. Our results show that the transaction costs contribute only marginally to the cost of borrowing, hence, we argue (using field data) that the programme, which has many additional benefits including ensuring financial inclusion of women and empowering them, should be strengthened and expanded further.",32.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2bpCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2bpCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=94&source=gbs_api,Do effective costs of borrowing limit their operation?,No link available

The role of social identity in shaping economic choices: Evidence from women’s self-help groups in India,"['Alvi, Muzna Fatima', 'Raghunathan, Kalyani', 'Sehgal, Mrignyani']","Group-based interventions are fast gaining traction in developing countries, often bolstering existing government service delivery systems. Such groups provide development programs with a means of extending their reach to households and individuals that might otherwise not seek public goods and services. However, the very reliance on the notion of “community” in these programs can constrain participation to those with a shared identity. In India, shared caste identity remains a central, and often controversial, element in many community-based programs. We explore the salience of caste identity with a field experiment conducted among women’s self-help groups in an eastern state of India. The experiment focused on the provision of information on nutrition, diet, and kitchen gardens. Specifically, we test the interplay between (a) the provision of information to self-help groups and (b) the caste identity of the information provider relative to the group’s caste identity, to assess what matters more –the message or the messenger. We randomize two treatments – an information treatment and ahomophily treatment – and measure the effect of these treatments on two outcomes: group members’willingness to contribute to a group-owned club good (a collectively managed kitchen garden), andindividual members’ retention of the information they received. We find that (1) information is veryimportant, (2) homophily, or shared caste identity with the information provider, is not that important,but (3) higher-caste information providers elicit greater willingness to contribute. These findings haveseveral implications for the design of public programs that rely on community-based organizations andagents as implementing partners and may thus be susceptible to identity issues, such as the exclusionof lower castes from certain occupations, public spaces or public goods.",35.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=He3GDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=He3GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=107&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=He3GDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-He3GDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

In today’s era, we have experienced an epidemic of mumbo-jumbo as we see a rise in cults, gurus, irrational panics, and moral confusion. According to Francis Wheen, this mumbo-jumbo has conquered the world and created a society full of superstition, relativism, and emotional hysteria. We see this in Middle Eastern fundamentalism, the rise of lotteries, astrology and mysticism, poststructuralism and the Third Way. In the Western societies of today, people have become disillusioned with mainstream politics and inundated with “self-improvement” books which have now become an $11 billion industry. The country that has become the most displaced by nonsense is the one founded to embody Enlightenment values: the USA. How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World aims to reveal how far the absurdity of our times has come and examines how many aspects of our lives are influenced by superstition and irrationality versus reason. As you read, you’ll learn about the rise of neoliberalism and how its policies created today’s income inequality and why self-help books rose in popularity in response to these policies.

HOW I OVERCAME MY TRAUMA & PTSD | Self-help guide & workbook | Mindfulness Based Trauma Treatment,['Philippe Izmailov'],"Are you haunted by awful memories of your past? Two years ago I was diagnosed with depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I suffered from anxiety, different fears, nasty feelings (especially sadness and anger), flashbacks and re-experiencing my traumas. I also used to experience plenty of stress, irritability, feelings of guilt, memory problems, sleeping problems and changes in mood. I tried to avoid these nasty experiences and to forget my bad memories but it did not help. My efforts were in vain. My traumas were caused by different traumatic events with were full of violence, physical and emotional abuse, aggression, emotional blackmail, bullying and mobbing (pestering). Most of these events happened during my childhood. For some time I have been treated by a psychologist, who applied several cures like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). As I was not satisfied with my progress, I developed and employed a successful self-help treatment to recover from psychological traumas and PTSD. I named it Mindfulness Based Trauma Treatment (MBTT). In my self-help workbook I describe step by step my treatment method based on the experiences with my own traumas. Mindfulness Based Trauma Treatment (MBTT) consists of elements from Mindfulness, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Buddhism and Psychology.

Power of Purpose by Michael Peres,['Michael Peres'],"In today’s busy, information-filled world, many of us spend the majority of our time and energy trying to get to the “next step”, without questioning what it’s all for. We strive for careers, salaries, and status, and neglect the core meaning behind our very existence, that is—our own purpose. Finding exactly what our purpose entails is not an overnight endeavor. It’s a lifetime exploration that combines our inherent values with our interests and passions. What we bring to the world and what we leave behind is derived from our consistent efforts towards the end goal. We focus so much on how we can satisfy one specific career, failing to realize that there can indeed, be several ways to become successful through different outlets. Success can mean many different things to different people. This book is not about how to become successful, more so than it is about how to pivot towards new types of frameworks that enable you to do what it is you’re actually passionate about. So many dream of getting out of the 9-5, but don’t know exactly how. In this case, the why precedes the how—once you establish a proper mindset, how to accomplish your vision will fall into place. Michael Peres is a serial entrepreneur that brings his wealth of experiences and setbacks in hopes of inspiring those that want to, but are hesitant to walk away from the jobs they’re not passionate about, to crafting work that is aligned with their visions and purpose. Think of this as the mental roadmap for getting out of the 9 to 5— with the outcome of doing the work that continuously inspires you for life.",18.0,['Business & Economics'],5.0,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=idhbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=idhbEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=155&source=gbs_api,"Adjusting your Vision, Mindset, and Purpose for Entrepreneurship",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=idhbEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-idhbEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Future Belongs to Those Who Innovate,['Michael Peres'],"The noise of bureaucracy. Some old traditions die hard. The pandemic has presented a rapid change in our environment, forcing companies that want to survive to optimize and adapt. Necessity is the mother of invention, and now what differentiates a thriving company from a dying one is how well it can separate value from noise. Much of that noise is bureaucratic practice. Though such practices were necessary in the past, many of these are archaic and have far outlived their time. Strict office hours, dress codes, slow decision-making mechanisms, and quarterly reviews — these put employees under unnecessary restraint, which isn't necessarily healthy for productivity. At the end of the day, your clients will remember the value you delivered — not what type of office you delivered it out of. A founder's goal should always be to put his or her energy towards creating exceptional and unique value; the rest is all noise. Here's how the pandemic has cut through that noise and redefined successful workplace models.",8.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RMNzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RMNzEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=160&source=gbs_api,Identify Bureaucratic Noise and Optimize for Success,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RMNzEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-RMNzEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Get Your Sh*t Together by Sarah Knight (Summary),"['QuickRead', 'Lea Schullery']","Do you want more free book summaries like this? Download our app for free at https://www.QuickRead.com/App and get access to hundreds of free book and audiobook summaries. Learn how to stop worrying about what you should do so you can finish what you need to do and start doing what you want to do. Welcome to Get Your Shit Together, before you keep reading you should know a few things. First, this is not a traditional self-help book. Instead, think about this as more of a “let Sarah help you help yourself” help book. In other words, Sarah is here to offer “help” when your “self” gets in the way. I mean, if you could help yourself, you would’ve done it by now, right? Second, this book is not about cleaning up your physical messes in your life. You won’t be getting tips about how to gather your shit, thank it for its service, and sending it off to the Salvation Army or Goodwill. Instead, you’ll be learning how to tidy up your mental clutter like your career, finances, creative pursuits, relationships, and health. Sarah thinks of this book as a “delightfully profane one-stop-shop for tidying your mind - and making your life easier and better.” No matter where you are in your life, whether you’re in a rut with your career, finances, or your health, you have the power to hoist yourself out of your rut and begin living the life you want, and deserve, to live. As you read, you’ll learn “how to set goals, how to push through small annoyances and thorny obstacles to meet those goals, and then how to imagine and achieve even bigger goals that you may not, until now, have thought possible.”",,['Study Aids'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TTHSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=TTHSDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=170&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TTHSDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TTHSDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Given the plight of millions of farmers the development of upland agriculture has become increasingly important.

Terapeutisk allians och olika sätt att förmedla internetbehandling med KBT vid depression,['Kristofer Vernmark'],"Depression är en funktionsnedsättande problematik som påverkar en stor del av den vuxna populationen varje år. Trots ett omfattande behov av hjälp så råder det brist på tillgång till effektiv behandling. Kognitiv Beteendeterapi (KBT) är en evidensbaserad metod som har stöd vid behandling av depression och förmedlad via internet skulle metoden kunna tillgängliggöras för fler. Dock är det i dagsläget oklart vilka format och vilket innehåll som kan användas när behandlingen förmedlas via internet, samt vilken betydelse den terapeutiska alliansen har för en behandling som till största del sker på distans. Syftet med denna avhandling var att undersöka effekterna för olika format av internetbehandling (epostterapi, guidad självhjälp och blended treatment) vid depression, samt alliansens roll i dessa format. Studiernas resultat visar på att epostterapi och internetförmedlade självhjälpsprogram med behandlarstöd var effektiva metoder för att behandla depression. Alliansskattningar var höga, vilket visar att en positiv terapeutisk allians kan uppnås i internetbehandling. Patientskattningar av allians kunde inte predicera utfallet i någon av behandlingarna, men behandlarskattad allians predicerade förbättring på depressionsskattningar i blended treatment. Den här avhandlingen innehåller den första randomiserade kontrollerade studien på KBT-baserad epostterapi vid depression, samt det första internet-förmedlade självhjälpsprogrammet baserat på beteendeaktivering och ACT. Depression is a debilitating disorder that affects a large part of the adult population every year. Yet there is still a lack of access to effective care for people in need. Cognitive Behaviour therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based method for treating depression that together with the increased availability of Internet services provides an opportunity to increase access to effective treatment. Internet-based interventions can be effective in the treatment of depression, but there is a lack of knowledge concerning which formats of delivery that can be used and if therapeutic alliance is of equal importance when providing treatment over the Internet. The overall aim of this thesis was to examine the effects of different treatment formats (email therapy, guided self-help, and blended treatment) in internet-based CBT for depression and to further examine the role of alliance in these treatment modalities. Findings from this thesis show that email therapy and internetbased treatment programs were effective methods for treating depression. Alliance ratings were high, showing that a positive therapeutic alliance can be achieved in internet-based treatments. Patient-rated alliance could not predict outcome in any of the different treatment formats. However, therapist-rated alliance predicted change in depression during blended treatment. This thesis includes the first randomized controlled study on CBTbased email therapy, and the first internet-based behavioral activation program with ACT-components, for adult depression.",90.0,,5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aOM9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aOM9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=187&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOM9DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aOM9DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"Pioneers of Zionism: Hess, Pinsker, Rülf",['Julius H. Schoeps'],"The emerging Jewish national consciousness in Europe toward the end of the 19th century claims many spiritual fathers, some of which have been seriously underestimated so far. Zionist intellectuals such as Moses Hess, Leon Pinsker and Isaac Rülf were already committed to the self-liberation of the Jewish people long before Theodor Herzl. Their experiences and observations brought them to believe that the emancipation and integration of Jews were not realistically possible in Europe. Instead, they began to think in national and territorial terms. The author explores the question as to what extent religious messianism influenced the ideas of these men and how this reflects in today's collective Israeli consciousness. In a comprehensive epilogue, Julius H. Schoeps critically correlates ideas of messianic salvation, Zionist pioneer ideals, the settler's movement before and after 1967, and the unsolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians which has been lasting for over 100 years.",166.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ciPoBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ciPoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=201&source=gbs_api,"Messianism, Settlement Policy, and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ciPoBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ciPoBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Learning together: Experimental evidence on the impact of group-based nutrition interventions in rural Bihar,"['Raghunathan, Kalyani', 'Kumar, Neha', 'Gupta, Shivani', 'Chauhan, Tarana', 'Kathuria, Ashi Kohli', 'Menon, Purnima']","Despite improvements over the last decade or more, India still accounts for a large proportion of the global prevalence of maternal and child undernutrition. We use a cluster-randomized controlled design and two waves of panel data on more than 2000 households from Bihar to analyse the impact on diet quality and anthropometry of a health and nutrition intervention delivered through an at-scale women’s self-help group (SHGs) platform. We find that the intervention had small but significant impacts on women and children’s dietary diversity, with the main impacts coming from an increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables and dairy, however, it had no impact on women’s body mass index. We identify several potential pathways to impact. To the extent that SHGs can effect broad-based social change, their current reach to millions of women makes them a powerful platform for accelerating improvements in maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes.",52.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QyfsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QyfsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=203&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QyfsDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-QyfsDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Smallholder Dairy Technology in Coastal Kenya,['Charles F. Nicholson'],"This study examined the factors influencing adoption of three related dairy technologies in coastal Kenya, and assessed the impacts of dairy adoption on household income, employment generation and nutrition status of pre-school children. The technologies studied were adoption of grade and crossbred dairy animals, planting of the fodder Napier grass and use of the infection and treatment method of immunisation against East Coast fever. A series of household surveys was conducted from mid-1997 to mid-1998. The descriptive results from surveys of 202 households in Coast Province indicate that adoption of a grade or crossbred dairy animal may result in substantial increases in household income, can generate paid (secondary) employment, and may improve the nutritional status of pre-school-age children in the Household. Econometric analyses, which controlled for numerous confounding factos, provided less consistent support for the impact of adoption on household income and paid employment. It appears that neither the adoption nor productivity of dairying are constrained by poor availability of technology options. For dairy development activities on the coast, two areas merit atention: mechanisms for easing access to grade and crossbred dairy cattle, either through credit schemes or through self-help smallholder co-operatives, and reducing the disease risks associated with grade and corssbred dairy animals.",72.0,['Dairying'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_LApK3XPnm0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_LApK3XPnm0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=204&source=gbs_api,An Adoption and Impact Study,No link available

The Success Acquifer,['Omar Choudhury'],"There is so much dissatisfaction in the world today. It almost feels like everyone is in a continuous struggle for self-fulfillment. Everyone is on the quest to live as much of “the good life” as they can. But regardless of what that life looks like to you, each one of us on this planet is striving for one thing: 'SUCCESS' Nobody wants to be a failure. But looking at it closely, you discover that there is a problem. And that is, that despite all the struggle and strife, not everyone is successful or has got as much success as they wish to have. And that begs the question, why isn’t everyone successful? Why is it that as one person starts a new journey towards success, another gets disillusioned and gives up on their quest to find it? The answer might surprise you. And after much thought, studies, and analysis I have shared what I believe to be the answer within this short book. My plan is to help you understand the real meaning of success and supply you with a basic blueprint on how you can achieve success yourself. Most people can define what failure is, but many find it hard to define what success means to them. It is this singular problem why a lot of people fail to achieve success and satisfaction, even when they want it so much. understanding what success means and looks like to you is the main key to opening the door towards it. Now, a question I have asked myself several times since starting my entrepreneurial journey was this: “How do we help more people to define what success means to them with clarity and purpose?” In this book, I have tried to help you dig deep to eyes and belly with the clarity, purpose, and energy that will make success all yours, no matter where you currently stand in the scheme of things. These are some of the exact steps I have taken to get me to where I am today. And with that being said, I hope you enjoy it Omar",27.0,['Self-Help'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FvwMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FvwMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=213&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FvwMEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FvwMEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"Math Is Easy So Easy, Algebra I",['Nathaniel Max Rock'],"There are many self-help math books available, but none are quite like this one. Math Is Easy, So Easy, first separates math topics into those which are essential and nonessential. The struggling math student (and parent of a struggling math student) must be able to focus on the math topics which will return the greatest effect in the shortest amount of time. Furthermore, math teachers and math textbooks simply try to cover too much material, the bulk of which, has no impact on a student's successful completion of math up through calculus in high school. Second, Math Is Easy, So Easy, tries to provide clarity of instruction for a few problems which cover the important aspects of the essential topics. Contrary to most math teacher instruction, it is more important and beneficial to know a few key problems well, than to try to cover many problems only superficially. If you are the parent of a student who is struggling in math, you know how frustrating it can be to get to the bottom of what your student really needs to know to survive and persist in math up through calculus in high school. You also know how important it is that your student stay in math as long as possible in high school, so that they are better prepared to enter and succeed in college. You also, no doubt, know how seemingly unreasonable your struggling student's math teacher can be in terms of communicating with you and your student. As a math teacher for many years now, Max wrote this book to help you and your struggling math student survive math with as few, ""I hate math,"" outbursts as possible. Lastly, Max has personally witnessed many students who struggle in math in high school who then go on to mature into great engineers and scientists. This book will help your student to stay in math longer and be more successful. There is a separate book for each of six math classes: 7th Grade Math, Algebra I, Geometry I, Algebra II, Math Analysis and Calculus. There is a single ""Combo"" book with all six books in one. Make sure you get the right book for your needs. Nathaniel Max Rock, an engineer by training, has taught math in middle school and high school including math classes: 7th Grade Math, Algebra I, Geometry I, Algebra II, Math Analysis and AP Calculus. Max has been documenting his math curricula since 2002 in various forms, some of which can be found on MathForEveryone.com, StandardsDrivenMath.com and MathIsEasySoEasy.com. Max is also an AVID elective teacher and the lead teacher for the Academy of Engineering at his high school.",92.0,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YPg4SqIUB0cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YPg4SqIUB0cC&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=216&source=gbs_api,,No link available

It is serves as a tool for: guidance; showcasing key principles in integrating gender into projects; stimulating the imagination of practitioners to apply lessons learned, experiences, and innovations to the design of future support and investment in the agriculture sector. The Sourcebook draws on a wide range of experience from World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and other donor agencies, governments, institutions, and groups active in agricultural development. The Sourcebook looks at: access to and control of assets; access to markets, information and organization; and capacity to manage risk and vulnerability through a gender lens. There are 16 modules covering themes of cross-cutting importance for agriculture with strong gender dimensions (Policy, Public Administration and Governance; Agricultural Innovation and Education; Food Security; Markets; Rural Finance; Rural Infrastructure; Water; Land; Labor; Natural Resource Management; and Disaster and Post-Conflict Management) and specific subsectors in agriculture (Crops, Livestock, Forestry, and Fisheries).

The Operational Evidence Base for Delivering Direct Nutrition Interventions in India,"['Rasmi Avula', 'Suneetha Kadiyala', 'Kavita Singh', 'Purnima Menon']","The persistence of undernutrition in the face of Indias impressive economic growth is of enormous concern. Less than 55 percent of mothers and children receive any essential health and nutrition inputs that are critical for improving maternal and child nutrition. We conducted a desk review (1) to document the extent to which national and civil society/NGO programs in India reflect current technical recommendations for nutrition and (2) assess the operational evidence base for implementing essential interventions for nutrition in the Indian context. We reviewed the design of the two major national programs, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Subsequently, we used Google Scholar to search the published literature from 2000 to 2012 for evidence of interventions addressing the inputs to improve child nutrition. Finally, we contacted 70 program stakeholders to identify the unpublished evidence on inputs in program models implemented by civil society/nongovernment organizations. We find that, by design, the two national programs (ICDS and NRHM) together appear to incorporate all the essential inputs and use evidence-based interventions. There is an expectation by design that the frontline workers of ICDS and NRHM coordinate and collaborate to deliver the interventions. A review of 22 program models shows that a majority focused on improving breastfeeding and timely initiation of complementary feeding. However, only a few addressed the full spectrum of complementary feeding, vitamin A deficiency, pediatric anemia, and severe acute malnutrition. None addressed how to reduce intestinal parasitic burdens or prevent malaria. There is limited published literature on the effectiveness of the recommended interventions to deliver the essential inputs. There are few efficacy studies and even fewer effectiveness studies or program evaluations on delivering essential nutrition interventions in the Indian context. The most commonly used delivery strategies across multiple essential inputs were home visits that involved individual or group counseling by community health workers or by self-help groups. Mass media and community events such as marriages and fairs were used as avenues to generate support for the interventions. Some programs used community mobilization to promote the interventions. Several of these programs worked to improve coordination and convergence between ICDS and NRHM and to strengthen these existing systems through training, improved monitoring, and supervision. Overall, a large gap persists in both the published and gray literature on how to promote interventions to address the essential inputs. Much more operational evidence is needed to ensure high-quality delivery of the evidence-based interventions that are already being implemented nationwide. Given the potential for the national programs to effectively deliver interventions to achieve maximum coverage and impact, and the government of Indias current interest in ICDS system strengthening, this is an opportune time to test some of the innovations using the ICDS and NRHM platforms.",72.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ITrvAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ITrvAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=243&source=gbs_api,A Desk Review,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ITrvAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ITrvAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Can Music Make You Sick?,"['Sally Anne Gross', 'George Musgrave']","“Musicians often pay a high price for sharing their art with us. Underneath the glow of success can often lie loneliness and exhaustion, not to mention the basic struggles of paying the rent or buying food. Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave raise important questions – and we need to listen to what the musicians have to tell us about their working conditions and their mental health.” Emma Warren (Music Journalist and Author). “Singing is crying for grown-ups. To create great songs or play them with meaning music's creators reach far into emotion and fragility seeking the communion we demand of it. However, music’s toll on musicians can leave deep scars. In this important book, Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave investigate the relationship between the wellbeing music brings to society and the wellbeing of those who create. It’s a much needed reality check, deglamorising the romantic image of the tortured artist.” Crispin Hunt (Multi-Platinum Songwriter/Record Producer, Chair of the Ivors Academy). It is often assumed that creative people are prone to psychological instability, and that this explains apparent associations between cultural production and mental health problems. In their detailed study of recording and performing artists in the British music industry, Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave turn this view on its head. By listening to how musicians understand and experience their working lives, this book proposes that whilst making music is therapeutic, making a career from music can be traumatic. The authors show how careers based on an all-consuming passion have become more insecure and devalued. Artistic merit and intimate, often painful, self-disclosures are the subject of unremitting scrutiny and data metrics. Personal relationships and social support networks are increasingly bound up with calculative transactions. Drawing on original empirical research and a wide-ranging survey of scholarship from across the social sciences, their findings will be provocative for future research on mental health, wellbeing and working conditions in the music industries and across the creative economy. Going beyond self-help strategies, they challenge the industry to make transformative structural change. Until then, the book provides an invaluable guide for anyone currently making their career in music, as well as those tasked with training and educating the next generation.",198.0,['Music'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=exoMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=exoMEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=246&source=gbs_api,Measuring the Price of Musical Ambition,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=exoMEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-exoMEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

A Meditation Technique For Instantaneous Enlightenment,['Dr. Gandhi Bhaskar Patrudu Lanka'],The true nature of self (soul) is bliss. It is not affected by any suffering. We suffer because we wrongly identify ourselves with thoughts and emotions. If the thought or emotion is pleasant we feel pleasure. If the emotion or thought is unpleasant we feel sadness. Thus when we falsely identify ourselves with thoughts or emotions we get carried away in this duality of pleasure and pain. True bliss is beyond this duality. Bliss is different from pleasure. When you are moved by pleasure. You are also affected by the opposite quality of pain. Only when you center yourself in your soul (true state) does you become free from this duality of pleasure and pain and experience infinite bliss beyond any duality.,14.0,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0MDxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0MDxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=259&source=gbs_api,Experience Bliss And Gain Freedom From Fear And Miseries Permanently,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0MDxDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-0MDxDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Forgetting the Past and Moving Into Your Purpose,['Alan Drake'],"At this time, more than any other time in our lives, it is vitally important for us to drop anything that will not help us reach the fullness of our purpose. It may even mean dropping something that helped us get to where we are now. Even if it was valuable in getting us where we are, if it will not help us on the path ahead, we must be almost merciless in dropping it and moving forward. Otherwise it could weigh us down and hinder us from reaching our destiny as we press on to what lies ahead. Runners who are serious about winning a race will go to great lengths to improve their speed. They will often refuse to wear or carry anything that might increase wind resistance and slow them down, hindering their chances of winning. Like those athletes, we’re in a race. We cannot afford to carry anything with us that is going to slow us down or hinder our chances of successfully finishing the race to fulfill our life purpose. There is an old proverb that says, “The good is the enemy of the best.” That may be truer today than it has ever been. We really don’t have time to waste on anything that is less than the very best use of our time and energy. We may have to forgo the enjoyment of many “good” things simply because our time is limited. Forget what lies behind. Press forward with a single focus on the narrow path ahead. Shed anything that hinders, weighs you down or distracts you from your highest purpose.

LIFE IS KARMA,['AiR'],"Life is Karma. As life unfolds day after day, we are confronted with circumstances, good and bad, and we wonder why things are happening the way they are. Is it luck, chance, serendipity or is it God instructing what should happen in our lives? It is none of these. It is Karma. Karma is a Law of Action, a Law of Action and Reaction, which is based on the principle, ‘as you sow, so shall you reap.’ Everything that is happening in our life is unfolding as per Karma. But we don't realize that it is twin Karma, one, the Karma of the past which we cannot change and second, the Karma of the present which depends on our free will, our choice of action that we choose based on our intellect. But it is not as simple as this. Everything that we do in life creates Karma. And even after we die, our Karma continues with our Mind and Ego, ME that takes rebirth on earth along with its karma.

Death is Wrong,['Gennady Stolyarov II'],"If you have ever asked, “Why do people have to die?” then this book is for you. The answer is that no, death is not necessary, inevitable, or good. In fact, death is wrong. Death is the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology. This book introduces you to the greatest, most challenging, most revolutionary movement to radically extend human lifespans so that you might not have to die at all. You will learn about some amazingly long-lived plants and animals, recent scientific discoveries that point the way toward lengthening lifespans in humans, and simple, powerful arguments that can overcome the common excuses for death. If you have ever thought that death is unjust and should be defeated, you are not alone. Read this book, and become part of the most important quest in human history. This book was written by the philosopher and futurist Gennady Stolyarov II and illustrated by the artist Wendy Stolyarov. It is here to show you that, no matter who you are and what you can do, there is always a way for you to help in humanity’s struggle against death.

Notes of a Potato Watcher,['James Lang'],"""Native to the New World, the potato was domesticated by Andean farmers, probably in the Lake Titicaca basin, almost as early as grain crops were cultivated in the Near East. Full of essential vitamins and energy-giving starch, the potato has proved a valuable world resource. Curious Spaniards took the potato back to Europe, from whence it spread worldwide. Today, the largest potato producer is China, with India not far behind.

The Lost Memories,['The Supreme Master Ching Hai'],"The Lost Memories is a collection of romantic poetry written by the Supreme Master Ching Hai during the 1970s while She was living in Europe. This time for Her was one of love and loss, ecstasy and heartbreak, longing and satiation, searching and discovering. The journey within this volume travels the road of Love, encompassing its spectrum – from effervescent passion to contemplative reflection. Each poem is filled with rich imagery and melody, resonating with the many thoughts, emotions and experiences common to us all. The longing for a loved one, sweet memories rekindled with each falling leaf, a lost bird finding its way home, the sound of raindrops – all are conveyed with utmost simplicity and tenderness. Woven into the wide range of emotions is a consistent theme, one that forms a gentle backdrop for each poem: the silhouette of Divine Love, which has been the source of inspiration throughout Master Ching Hai’s lifelong journey. This journey to embrace True Love not only invites a passionate delving into the depths of our life experience, it also provides the potent reminder that in our own Lost Memories lies the key to selfdiscovery and, ultimately, our self-realization. We are deeply grateful to Supreme Master Ching Hai for allowing us to compile this collection from Her early years. While the obvious beauty of this poetry springs forth from the innocent heart of youth, its inner beauty takes equal form by sparking the spiritual yearning deep within all of us. We hope that The Lost Memories helps you find peace and love on your journey.",78.0,['Poetry'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_vTKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_vTKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=302&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_vTKDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_vTKDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Psychology of Silicon Valley,['Katy Cook'],"Misinformation. Job displacement. Information overload. Economic inequality. Digital addiction. The breakdown of democracy, civility, and truth itself. This open access book explores the conscious and unconscious norms, values, and characteristics that drive behaviors within the high-tech capital of the world, Silicon Valley, and the sector it represents. In an era where the reach and influence of a single industry has the potential to define the future of our world, it has become apparent just how little we know about the organizations driving these changes. The Psychology of Silicon Valley offers a revealing look inside the mind of world’s most influential industry and how the identity, culture, myths, and motivations of Big Tech are harming society. The book argues that the bad values and lack of emotional intelligence borne in the vacuum of Silicon Valley will have lasting consequences on everything from social equality to the future of work to our collective mental health. Katy Cook expertly walks us through the psychological landscape of Silicon Valley, including its leadership, ethical, and cultural problems, and artfully explains why we cannot afford to ignore the psychology and values that are behind our technology any longer.",314.0,['Psychology'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kpm2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kpm2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=310&source=gbs_api,Ethical Threats and Emotional Unintelligence in the Tech Industry,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kpm2DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kpm2DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Art of Frame Control,['JetSet (Josh King Madrid)'],"Do you ever wish you could have unshakeable conviction and absolute certainty in yourself? Do you ever get the feeling that there is some sort of hidden key to social influence, and that if you just knew what it was, you could have more success, more money, and more easily influence other people? Then let JetSet help you with The Art Of Frame Control! From the author of JETSET Life Hacks and the host of Josh King Madrid on The Dropout Degree show, Josh King Madrid, better known as JetSet is an internet celebrity, entrepreneur, neuromarketer, NLP coach and founder of NFT Magazine. Gaining a greater degree of control over one's internal and external psychology is the most important factor in increasing one's level of success in all aspects of life. Gaining a greater degree of control over one's internal and external psychology is the most important factor in increasing one's level of success in all aspects of life. The collective congruency between your internal self and your external results is what I call Frame Control. When this energy field is overwhelmed by influence (power) it gets absorbed and our mind becomes extremely suggestible and if this energy field gets overwhelmed by manipulation (force), it collapses and our mental defenses fail. When that happens we become subject to another person’s ideas, desires and commands, and then that person can impose his will on us. When you master The Art of Frame Control, it will be simple to convince everybody else to readily agree with you and see the world through your point of view. This will make it easier to accomplish your goals. What the most successful business leaders, corporate leaders, and politicians already know, namely, that the key to success comes from a specifically formulated mindset is that the key to success comes from a specifically formulated mindset which ultimately the art of frame control itself. Frame Control is all about being aware of what it takes to succeed, no matter the situation. Finding your center and being aware of what influences you are necessary in order to exert your will on others and exercise frame control. Learn how to take advantage of this well-kept psychological secret rather than allowing yourself to be influenced and manipulated by those who are already in the know about it. Learn this powerful NLP concept, Frame Control and you will be able to gain the upper hand in any social situation, whether you are trying to land a big deal, convince your spouse to get on board with a decision, or pick up a hot date. The nature of reality is inherently ambiguous and is open to various interpretations. Whoever is more confident in their interpretation will be able to sway everyone's interpretations around them. In this book you will learn: ✔ Why Frame Control creates social authority and how it is experienced ✔ Examples of how reality unfolds at the various level of Frame Control strength ✔ The four things you must have to create a powerful and even invisible frame that will continuously improve your life ✔ Multiple types of Frames you can use to yield the results you want ✔ The Framing effect and how people use it to influence you and how you can use it to start influencing others ✔ The different types of Framing effects with real life examples you have most definitely experienced before ✔ How to win in a head-to-head Frame battle and get what you want ✔ The different types of Framing effects with real life examples you have most definitely experienced before ✔ The Russell Brand Method and taking charge of conversational frames This book is for you if you're prepared to have unshakeable conviction and absolute certainty!",52.0,['Self-Help'],5.0,27.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UnqKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UnqKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=320&source=gbs_api,How To Effortlessly Get People To Readily Agree With You & See The World Your Way by Josh King Madrid (JetSet),https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UnqKEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UnqKEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

These goods were stolen from governments and civilians in the countries Germany overran and from Jewish and non-Jewish victims of the Nazis alike, included Jews murdered in extermination camps, from whom everything was taken down to the gold fillings of their teeth.",212.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1dRKMeIM6EcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1dRKMeIM6EcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=333&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Idiots are invincible,['Dr Angelos Rodafinos'],"Who are the idiots? This is one of the few questions in the world that most people agree on its answer: The others... (of course!). Managers, colleagues, teachers, spouses, mothers-in-law -- anyone who doesn’t behave ‘properly,’ that is, the way... we would like them to! Join the Boneheads’ Academy. Congratulations! You’ve just won free life time membership to the idiots’ club, as chances are that you belong to several of the above categories. Time to realize that, if we ask others, you are the idiot in their lives! Idiotic thinking. Time to also realize that, all too often, we are the ‘idiots’ for ourselves! Irrational thoughts and beliefs create problems for our own selves and for those around us. There is hope. The infallible ‘Ro’ method can help you become a professional problem solver, and deal with annoying people, situations, and your own thoughts. A day with Don Stressote. Join in the adventures of this modern-day Don Quixote de la Mancha, a ‘Ro’ method graduate. Watch Don deal effectively with other idiots (drivers, managers, colleagues, clients, friends and relatives), as well as with the most difficult person among all... - himself! A ‘normal’ life is not always a ‘happy’ life. “… grant me the courage to change the things that I can change, the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference between the two”, is a popular motto by Alcoholics Anonymous. Most of us fail in the third part, as we hopelessly try to change things that either are not amenable to change or unworthy of our time and energy. Dealing effectively with either major life events or daily stressors requires the ability to maintain composure / remain calm under pressure, take a time-out and ‘talk sense’ to oneself. Useful questions to ponder when under pressure include: -Is there something I can do right now to solve this problem? -Is it worth my time and energy? -Is my behaviour helping me deal with this and accomplish my ultimate goals? -What can happen to me, if I continue acting in a state of frenzy or remain depressed? -How long can my body endure in this state, without sustaining any undesirable health consequences? -How can I use this event? -What have I learned from it? -What good do I see in all of it? You can’t stop the birds of worry from flying over your head - but you can stop them from building their nest on your head. The book aims to inspire, as well as to educate. In the first part the author discusses stress, its sources and its effects, followed by the ‘Ro’ Method, a simple but complete problem solving process, and a number of examples and real life applications. Then, using a light, humorous and innovative style, the author describes the day of ‘Don Stressote,’ a modern Don Quichote de la Mancha and ‘Ro’ Method graduate, who attempts to apply the theory in everyday life situations. Armed with courage and stoicism, Don deals with the monsters and the dragons (the idiots) of the 21st century: his partner who entered the toilette first and is reading the newspaper insensible to the needs of others, the obese fellow in the elevator, the traffic jam, his stupid boss, the thick-skinned client, as well as the most difficult person among all – his own self and his irrational expectations… Don’s positive state of mind, and his determination and focus on his pledge “I won’t let any idiot ruin my day, ‘cause this is my day!” together with a careful plan of action on how to deal with little annoyances and seemingly unsurpassable obstacles, is what distinguishes our hero from the average/normal citizen. A number of applied psychological techniques, combined with examples and exercises assist the reader to make positive changes towards a) either solving problems or b) altering the way s/he sees the situations.",50.0,['Psychology'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q4eWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q4eWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=336&source=gbs_api,"The fool-proof “Ro” method for solving problems, dealing with challenges - and enjoying the process!",No link available

One Flew Over The Rainbow,['Ruth Ella Moragas'],"One Flew Over The Rainbow by Ruth Ella Morargas will take you from Ruth’s troubled yet beautiful childhood, where her vibrant and joyful personality started to fracture; through her teen years of embracing who she was, despite panic and meltdowns. Into early adulthood where her personality was almost entirely robbed, and mental illness took the forefront. And then culminating in her recent transformation - as the wonder and healing of knowing Jesus and getting creative, helped bring her into recovery. Ruth is now healthy, happy and dreaming again! She has successfully regained who she was always meant to be – and so can you! This book will give you valuable insight and tools for your own recovery (or if you are a carer or professional). Ruth Ella Moragas founded and co-directed mental health organisation Happy Heads UK for 5 years, where people were empowered to look at their gifts, strengths and skills, rather than diagnoses and stigmas. Ruth herself loves to write, paint, dance and sing. Creativity has been one of the most effective outlets in her own recovery from mental health problems. Using all of this valuable experience (and through divine inspiration from the Holy Spirit) Ruth has developed her own, unique recovery tool – The Balance Ball. This is explained thoroughly towards the end of the book, including a full Balance Ball Booklet to help you on your own journey into wellness. Ruth has humbly decided to give this book away for free, because she would love it to help as many people as possible.

Wasting Time on God,['Paulo Bitencourt'],"Visit: rebrand.ly/freethought “In every line, an explosion of lucidity and logic! Paulo Bitencourt argues with more clarity and humor than Richard Dawkings, Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and, unlike them, speaks from experience.” — L. Karnal ★★★★★ Best book I’ve ever read. «I’m speechless. This book is splendid and should be read by everyone. The author's analyses are sensational and easy to understand. I don't usually rate books, but for this one I felt obliged to show my immense gratitude.» (N. Rocha) ★★★★★ Bombastic! «It’s difficult to put into words what this magnificent literary work made me feel. It perfectly synthesized everything I think about religion and went even further: it removed all my doubts. I can only thank the author for this dazzling experience.» (L. Pondé) ★★★★★ It’s a pity I didn’t know about this work earlier! «This book helped me to free myself from the guilt and depression caused in me by Christianity, which enslaved me, almost destroyed my sanity and made me lose the will to live. Now, as a freethinker, I am regaining joy.» (J. Correa) Among theological, philosophical and historical arguments, in Wasting Time on God Paulo Bitencourt, who was a devout Adventist, active in the church, a Theology student and almost became a pastor, reveals the reasons why he does not believe in invisible beings, including the celestial ones, and undoubtedly demonstrates that Atheism is the only intellectually honest stance. Do you have faith in God? Is it unshakable? How do you know, if you do not put it to the test? Read Wasting Time on God to the end. If this book does not make you doubt any of the things you believe, nothing else will. It will prove that you really stand firm in the faith. Topics covered: Allah, Atheism, Bible, Christianity, Adventist, Baptist, Catholic, Evangelical, Pentecostal Church, Communism, Devil, Evolution, Freethought, God, Gospel, Heaven, Hell, Islam, Jesus, Judaism, Mohammed, Philosophy, Protestantism, Satan, Science, Skepticism, Socialism, etc. Paulo Bitencourt was born in Paraná, Brazil, spent his childhood in Rio de Janeiro, his youth in Paraná and studied Theology in São Paulo. Close to becoming a pastor, he moved to Europe, eventually settling in Austria. The book Ethics, by Bento de Espinosa (Baruch Spinoza), turned him into a naturalist, humanist and freethinker. Paulo Bitencourt dedicates his life to helping people liberate themselves from religion. Paulo Bitencourt is the author also of the books Liberated from Religion: The Inestimable Pleasure of Being a Freethinker and Com Zeus Não Se Brinca: Loucuras da Crença em Deus (Zeus Is Not to Be Played With: Madnesses of the Belief in God).",173.0,['Religion'],5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yPd7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yPd7EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=372&source=gbs_api,Why I Am an Atheist,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yPd7EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yPd7EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
"The History, Present State, and Future of Information Technology",['Andrew Targowski'],"In Part I, Prof. Targowski takes us through the evolution of modern computing and information systems. While much of this material is familiar to those of us who have lived through these developments, it would definitely not be familiar to our children or our students. He also introduces a perspective that I found both refreshing and useful: looking at the evolution on a country by country basis. For those of us who live in the U.S., it is all too easy to imagine that evolution to be a purely local phenomenon. I found my appreciation of the truly global nature of computing expanding as he walked me through each country’s contributions. In Parts II and III, constituting nearly half of the book, Targowski provides what I would describe as an in-depth case study of the challenges and successes of informatics in Poland. As he tells each story—many of which involved him personally—the reader cannot help but better understand the close relationship between the freedoms that we in the west take for granted and the ability to produce innovations in IT. Even after Poland left the orbit of the former Soviet Union, the remaining vestiges of the old way of thinking remained a major impediment to progress. Being right and being rigorous were far less important than being in tune with the “approved” ways of thinking. There are important lessons to be learned here, particularly as we try to project how IT will evolve in rapidly developing economies such as China. But, from my experience, they apply equally well to western academia, where moving outside of preferred values and patterns of research can lead a scholar to be ignored or even disparaged. In Part IV, Targowski presents a bold, forward-looking synthesis of informatics and informing science in the future. Building upon articles recently published in Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline, he presents a conceptual scheme of historical informing waves that builds upon historians such as Toynbee. He then considers how these trends will necessarily force us to rethink how we develop and apply IT. He does not steer away from the controversial. But he also provides cogent arguments for all his predictions and recommendations.",,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fUR4CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fUR4CwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Selfhelp&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=373&source=gbs_api,,No link available

THE EMERGING TRENDS IN ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN NIGERIA AND INDIA.,['Adedayo Jeremiah Adeyekun'],"This book was edited by Prof. Prabhubhai K. Patel (Emeritus Professor of Architecture from IIT, Roorkee (Oldest Technical Institution of Asia) and Prof. Olu Ola Ogunsote, a renowned Professor of Architecture at the School of Environmental Technology, Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria. This book is written to suggest ways on how to improve architectural education and a comparative study was done between Nigeria and India. The book examines the current issues in architectural education in both countries and the way forward. Solutions to the current problems encountered by the governing architectural education authorities in both countries are carefully highlighted after a research was done. The quality of architectural education should have direct impact on the architectural product of that society. The architectural education of any nation should be a weapon for physical development. Architectural education and practice are experiencing a shift of Interdisciplinary characterized by the coordinating, articulating and dominant role of digital technologies; therefore there is a need to upgrade the curriculum in order to fit into the current technological system. According to the most influential architectural professional body in the world, Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the education review group representing academia and practice, intends to catalyse relevant new models for architectural education to be taken forward and established by schools of architecture. This will help to push architectural education to the next level by setting a target to meet with the current societal challenges. It is an important thing for any nation to make changes to architectural education as time goes on to avoid risk of becoming irrelevant.

Wisdom for the Soul of Black Folk,['Roderick Terry'],"Another book of quotations? Indeed there are numerous excellent extant anthologies of quotations, but these tend to be very broad, with a bias toward classical and well-known authors; those works which document the contributions of Black authors have tended to focus on African-Americans, considerable as their output is. Undeniable recognition of this prevalence is reflected in the title of the present volume which pays homage to W. E. B. Du Bois? classic work and in the preponderance of entries from American sources. Nevertheless, effort has been made to cast a wider net to capture under-represented and unfamiliar voices. Khemetic texts preserved in papyri and stelae are the earliest literature to have survived, followed by the writings of North African Romans and Ethiopian philosophers and clerics, and the lately recovered Timbuktu manuscripts from their repositories in the desert sands of Mali. The Transatlantic slave experience gave rise to the slave narratives and abolitionist literature from both sides of the Atlantic, which remained predominant right up to the 20th century. Post-Emancipation under colonial rule and white domination, Black poetry and prose emerged, adhering to prevailing standards, evidenced typically in the work of Phillis Wheatley and the sonnets of Claude McKay. With the Civil Rights and Black Power movements would come iconoclastic expressions of protest and identity. There is a sizeable body of literature by Black authors from Africa and the diaspora who speak to universal values and eternal verities. This anthology of their work focuses on the inner life, on personal development and self-actualization. 3000 quotations have been selected to inspire, enlightenand encourage; they have been arranged in 200 psycho-spiritual categories and in chronological order. The resulting timeline of thought in itself is useful and instructive as it demonstrates very clearly the evolution of consciousness evident in the contemporary thinking on particular subjects. Like its predecessor, Wisdom for the Soul: Five Millennia of Prescriptions for Spiritual Healing, this volume contains a full biographical index and bibliographical references.

On History,['Jules Michelet'],"Edited by Lionel Gossman, this volume contains three programmatic essays by Michelet. The first two are available here for the first time in English translation. The third, the Preface to the 1869 edition of the Histoire de France, originally published in its first English translation by Edward K. Kaplan in his Michelet’s Poetic Vision (1977), has been revised by the translator for this volume. One of the greatest Romantic historians and immensely popular during his lifetime, Jules Michelet (1798-1874) fell into disfavour among the positivist historians who came after him and who regarded his work with disdain as ""literature."" In the 1920s and 30s, however, he began to be rediscovered and rehabilitated by the members of the influential Annales school. The objects of Michelet’s interest—living conditions, popular mentalities, laws and the arts, the historian’s relation to the objects of his study, no less than political history—have since come to occupy a central place in modern historical research.

The History of Pittsburgh,['Sarah Hutchins Killikelly'],"Miss Killikelly’s book is more than a history of Pittsburgh, and all but serves as a history of Allegheny County, of which Pittsburgh has long been the metropolis, and which since the creation of the Greater Pittsburgh — brought about since this book was published — stands more than ever as the expression of the civic activities of its adjacent territory. With the chief facts of the early history of Pittsburgh, especially with those that center around Fort Duquesne, most readers of Pennsylvania history are fairly familiar. The story of these early days lose nothing in Miss Killikelly's retelling. Very marvelous, indeed, has been the growth of this great Pennsylvania city. A record of its population in 1761 gives the number of men as 324, the women 92 and children 47, living outside the garrison; the number of houses with owners' names was 220. At this period the town was divided into a Lower and Upper Town; the ""King's Gardens"" stretching along the Allegheny, with a background of wheatfields. The residence of the commandant, a substantial brick building within the fort, was the most pretentious house. In 1815 the population had increased to nearly 10,000. The subsequent history of this city is too detailed to be summarized. Miss Killikelly tells the story in ample manner, yet without any overloading of unessential facts. Her pages throb with the active, busy life that has made Pittsburgh so pre-eminently a manufacturing center, and she tells the story of its commercial, industrial and cultural progress with the skill of a practiced writer. Pittsburgh is probably the most misunderstood city in the United States, and Miss Killikelly is entitled to cordial thanks for her entirely readable account.",706.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=poRU0YjqrzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=poRU0YjqrzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=History&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=94&source=gbs_api,Its Rise and Progress,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=poRU0YjqrzsC&rdid=book-poRU0YjqrzsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

"A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins",['John Beckmann'],"In revising Beckmann's celebrated Work, we have endeavoured to improve it principally by altering such names, characters, descriptions, and opinions as have become obsolete, or are now known to be erroneous; and by such additions as seemed necessary to bring the accounts of the subjects treated of to the present state of knowledge. In some cases, these additions may appear to diverge from the declared object of the work; but in this we have only followed the example of Beckmann himself, who frequently deviates from a strict historical path, and we think advantageously, for the purpose of introducing curious, instructive, or amusing information. In most cases, where the subject under consideration is a process of manufacture, we have given a brief outline of its practice or theory, unless this had previously been done by the author. The translation, also, has been carefully compared with the German, but in only a very few cases could we detect errors which rendered the passages contradictory or unintelligible: on the whole, it is extremely well executed; and too much praise cannot be given to Johnston, for the judicious manner in which he has embodied in one article, detached essays on the same subject, which Beckmannviii published at different periods, as he acquired fresh information.",574.0,['Inventions'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SiaPDy1TFz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=SiaPDy1TFz4C&pg=PP1&dq=History&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=164&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SiaPDy1TFz4C&rdid=book-SiaPDy1TFz4C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Spatial history is not a field with clearly delineated boundaries. For the most part, it lacks a distinct, unambiguous scholarly identity. It can only be thought of in relation to other, typically more established fields. Indeed, one of the most valuable utilities of spatial history is its capacity to facilitate conversations across those fields. Consequently, it must be discussed in relation to a variety of historiographical contexts. Each of these have their own intellectual genealogies, institutional settings, and conceptual path dependencies.

The expansion of the History came at the expense of the sketches, reviews and other essays so that the nineteenth-century publication ceased to have the miscellaneous character of its eighteenth-century forebear, although poems continued to be included until 1862, and a small number of official papers and other important texts continue to be reproduced to this day. Includes a long historical essay on the “History of the Present War” (the Seven Years' War 1756–63). In his preface to the 1758 volume Burke noted the difficulties he had faced in writing the history section of the book. Taking the “broken and unconnected materials” and creating from them “one connected narrative” had been, he commented, “a work of more labour than may at first appear.” The 1758 volume is considered a unique, contemporaneous account of the Seven Years' War, analyzing its origins and development with a perspective not readily available at the time in newspapers or magazines.",922.0,"['Anglo-Dutch War, 1780-1784']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wtIaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wtIaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=347&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wtIaAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-wtIaAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Ancient Greek I,['Philip S. Peek'],"In this elementary textbook, Philip S. Peek draws on his twenty-five years of teaching experience to present the ancient Greek language in an imaginative and accessible way that promotes creativity, deep learning, and diversity. The course is built on three pillars: memory, analysis, and logic. Readers memorize the top 250 most frequently occurring ancient Greek words, the essential word endings, the eight parts of speech, and the grammatical concepts they will most frequently encounter when reading authentic ancient texts. Analysis and logic exercises enable the translation and parsing of genuine ancient Greek sentences, with compelling reading selections in English and in Greek offering starting points for contemplation, debate, and reflection. A series of embedded Learning Tips help teachers and students to think in practical and imaginative ways about how they learn. This combination of memory-based learning and concept- and skill-based learning gradually builds the confidence of the reader, teaching them how to learn by guiding them from a familiarity with the basics to proficiency in reading this beautiful language.

The Bible in Buffalo Country,"['Sally K. May', 'Laura Rademaker', 'Donna Nadjamerrek', 'Julie Narndal Gumurdul']","Arriving in the remote Arnhem Land Aboriginal settlement of Oenpelli (Gunbalanya) in 1925, Alf and Mary Dyer aimed to bring Christ to a former buffalo shooting camp and an Aboriginal population many whites considered difficult to control. The Bible in Buffalo Country: Oenpelli Mission 1925–1931 represents a snapshot of the tumultuous first six years of the Church Missionary Society’s mission at Oenpelli and the superintendency of Alfred Dyer between 1925 and 1931. Drawing together documentary and photographic sources with local community memory, a story emerges of miscommunication, sickness, constant logistical issues, and an Aboriginal community choosing when and how to engage with the newcomers to their land. This book provides a fascinating and detailed record of the primary sources of the mission, placed alongside the interpretation and insight of local Traditional Owners. Its contents include the historical and archaeological context of the primary source material, the vivid mission reports and correspondence, along with stunning photographs of the mission and relevant maps, and finally the oral history of Esther Manakgu, presenting Aboriginal memory of this complex era. The Bible in Buffalo Country emerged from community desire for access to the source documents of their own history and for their story to be known by the broader Australian public. It is intended for the benefit of communities in western Arnhem Land and is also a rich resource for historians of Aboriginal history (and other scholars in relevant disciplines).",332.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a10MEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a10MEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=History&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=597&source=gbs_api,Oenpelli Mission 1925–1931,No link available
Digital Scholarly Editing,"['Matthew James Driscoll', 'Elena Pierazzo']","This volume presents the state of the art in digital scholarly editing. Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editions—and the theories that underpin them. The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind. Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation of the discipline—one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and printed works from across literary history, and the globe. The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing, along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting point for further scholarship.

Medical Management of Abortion,['World Health Organization'],Medical abortion care encompasses the management of various clinical conditions including spontaneous and induced abortion (both viable and non-viable pregnancies) incomplete abortion and intrauterine fetal demise as well as post-abortion contraception. Medical management of abortion generally involves either a combination regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or a misoprostol-only regimen. Medical abortion care plays a crucial role in providing access to safe effective and acceptable abortion care. In both high- and low-resource settings the use of medical methods of abortion have contributed to task shifting and sharing and more efficient use of resources. Moreover many interventions in medical abortion care particularly those in early pregnancy can now be provided at the primary-care level and on an outpatient basis which further increases access to care. Medical abortion care reduces the need for skilled surgical abortion providers and offers a non-invasive and highly acceptable option to pregnant individuals.,72.0,['Medical'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kHOyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kHOyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=History&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=722&source=gbs_api,,No link available

A Time Travel Dialogue,['John W. Carroll'],"Is time travel just a confusing plot device deployed by science fiction authors and Hollywood filmmakers to amaze and amuse? Or might empirical data prompt a scientific hypothesis of time travel? Structured on a fascinating dialogue involving a distinguished physicist, Dr. Rufus, a physics graduate student and a computer scientist this book probes an experimentally supported hypothesis of backwards time travel – and in so doing addresses key metaphysical issues, such as causation, identity over time and free will. The setting is the Jefferson National Laboratory during a period of five days in 2010. Dr. Rufus’s experimental search for the psi-lepton and the resulting intractable data spurs the discussion on time travel. She and her two colleagues are pushed by their observations to address the grandfather paradox and other puzzles about backwards causation, with attention also given to causal loops, multi-dimensional time, and the prospect that only the present exists. Sensible solutions to the main puzzles emerge, ultimately advancing the case for time travel really being possible. A Time Travel Dialogue addresses the possibility of time travel, approaching familiar paradoxes in a rigorous, engaging, and fun manner. It follows in the long philosophical tradition of using dialogue to present philosophical ideas and arguments, but is ground breaking in its use of the dialogue format to introduce readers to the metaphysics of time travel, and is also distinctive in its use of lab results to drive philosophical analysis. The discussion of data that might decide whether time is one-dimensional (one timeline) or multi-dimensional (branching time) is especially novel.",94.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bug8BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Bug8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Travel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=4&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bug8BAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Bug8BAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Become a Travel Agent in 2022!,['Lia Vincent'],"Become a travel agent and ""Combine Your Passion For Travel, With A Purpose For Building A Business!"" Vincent Vacations is an award winning travel agency. We have a storefront location in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with a great in-office staff and a team of over 100 independent travel advisors who work all across the country. A big misconception in the travel industry, someone has to be “certified” or go to school to become a travel agent. You don’t technically need either to become a travel agent. You just need a travel agency to allow you to sign-up and use their credentials to sell travel. Here is where I say...BUT, do you want to work with a travel agency that accepts everyone with 0 qualification requirements? I don’t want to talk bad about these agencies, but in my opinion it really waters down the agency community. It creates poorly trained (or not trained at all) travel agents out in the communities we live in that use our designation as “travel agent” that for example I have sat next to people on a plane and they respond cautiously, “But are you a REAL travel agent?” I know exactly what they are talking about. I am going to go into detail on how to become a REAL travel agent and how to be successful in my opinion. This is how I run my travel agency. We have quickly risen to the top. We are recognized by companies such as Disney Destinations, American Airlines Vacations, Apple Leisure Group, Delta Vacations, and more as a top travel agency in the United States. 1) Find an agency that will mentor you. At Vincent Vacations, we train people that have never been in the travel industry before. I will say there is a lot of misunderstanding in what we do. A lot of people think that because they can navigate Expedia, then they too can be a travel agent. This is not the case. Once a client has gotten to the point of selecting where they want to go, what hotel they want and what dates...putting in the names and birthdates of the travelers is the easy part. It’s something most middle school kids could do. The hard part is helping them select the resort or hotel. Helping them navigate the cruise options or what they should do while at Walt Disney World to know how many days to book. It’s building a rapport with the client so they trust and value your opinion on all of these things. There is too much information out there and people come to a travel agent to help them narrow down their search. Finding an agency that values training and knowledge is KEY. We train in groups. We do an introductory 3 day training with business development managers from hoteliers and cruise lines so the newbies (as we call them) can hear the passion and information from the sales reps we work closely with. Another benefit I see with the group trainings, you start to build relationships with the other agents. They are learning things for the first time just like you. Everyone will likely have the same questions and be at the same stage for at least the first little bit. You start to build this in the training so the group training is non-negotiable for me. I do get a lot of requests to just watch the recorded trainings or sign up without it but then this start of community would be lost. This industry is made up of 2 different types of travel agents. A brick and mortar agent who works full time in an office and an independent contractor (IC). The independent contractors don’t have the benefit of working in an office. The idea of the office, where you can quickly bounce ideas off each other, and learn from each other. At Vincent Vacations our IC team is a community. As part of how the agency mentors our team, we are big on this community with helping each other. We do a weekly team meeting via ZOOM, team building activities, a yearly retreat, awards party, FAM trips (I’ll talk more about FAMs in another section) and we have a private Facebook group where everyone can utilize to brainstorm. 2) Travel where you sell, and share your experience. This can be an expensive job at first. I joke with some of the agents to see what their spouses think of their new job. It can be difficult at first but it’s so important. We are a traveling agency. I put a lot of emphasis on this and when sales reps come to me and say, “how can we get more business” I am always saying, “Take us on a FAM”. A FAM is a Familiarization trip. It is when travel agents travel together to tour hotels or resorts or experience a destination. A FAM trip can be a short weekend trip to Mexico where you see 15 hotels in 3 days or a tour of Italy. There’s not really a specific category but they are so important. When you meet someone and you can speak confidently about a destination it can be a game changer on closing a sale. “I was just in Cancun and I would love to tell you about the airport experience and my top 3 hotels I think you would love when we are working on your trip.” Do FAM trips cost money? Most of them, yes they do. They are typically very discounted. They are a lot of work. I have never been so tired than on a FAM trip where we went from hotel to hotel in the heat seeing every room category. We started taking pictures of the name of the hotel so we could wrap our brain around which pictures are which. When you’re done you’re always so glad you went. You make new friends, build relationships with the hoteliers and gain so much knowledge. Share your pictures on social media. Save some. Share a little a at time. Create albums of your FAMs so you don’t forget and it can become such a resource. You will be glad you did. 3) Maximize Social Media Someone recently asked in a social media group I am in if I let my clients be “my friend” on social media. My answer without hesitating is YES. If you want to be successful, the quickest path and least expensive path is through social media. Picture this…….you book someone a trip to Mexico. You’re new and inexperienced. You might not have shined during the booking process but you did a fine job. Will the client remember to call you in a couple years when they are ready for their next trip? IFFY. If you’re connected on social media will they? YES! Of course not guaranteed but think about it. They start to feel like they know you. They see you traveling for your job as an agent. They see you posting reviews of hotels, other client experiences and treating it as a profession. We also encourage all of our team to build a Facebook group. This is where they can put together travel inspiration and example trips, (we provide the content to our team for a lot of this), people can ask questions and you can run it like a business. Agents with a travel focused Facebook group consistently sell more travel than those who don’t have one. The ones with 2-3k people in their groups have more business than they know what to do with. This only works if you treat social media as a business. What image do you want to portray? Keep social media positive. Keep it lighthearted. Post funny pictures of your kids, your weekend cooking venture and your travels. Do not post your family drama. Do not post politics. Politics is sure to alienate half of your audience. Be intentional. Who do you admire on social media? Why do you admire them? Is it because they complain, post low quality photos and rant nonstop? Of course not. Everyone on your social media is either a client or a potential client. Once you emerge yourself into this thought process you will see an uptick in business. 4) Join a Referral Group Referral groups can be so helpful when you immerse yourself and use it to your advantage. This is where you will refer other members of the group to their businesses and they will return the favor. It’s a great way to expand your network outside of what you already have. If you don’t know of any, this is a great time to start one. This way you can set the rules and expectations. 5) Never stop training. This is huge. This job is fluid. Everything is always changing. There’s always a new policy or even a new destination to learn about. There are conferences that will help you focus on your niche and become an expert. For example if your focus is romance travel then conferences like Love Mexico or Romance Travel Forum should be on your priority list. There are cruise conferences like Cruise World or RiverView Conference if you want to focus specifically on River Cruises. The training is as important as networking at these events. This is where you will meet other agents that also have this focus. Agents with a core group of agents that they can bounce ideas off of are much more successful than those who isolate themselves. Becoming a travel agent has blessed me and my family so much. After the pandemic we joke that it’s not for the faint of heart but as travel returns I have seen the need for professional travel agents more and more. The value has been shown over and over and it’s a profession not going away.

The Art of Travel by Alain de Botton (Summary),"['QuickRead', 'Lea Schullery']","Do you want more free books like this? Download our app for free at https://www.QuickRead.com/App and get access to hundreds of free book and audiobook summaries. Discover the art of travel and learn how to appreciate and make the most of your next trip. Many times we find ourselves overly stressed about work, relationships, and life. During these times, we fantasize about being somewhere else and just escaping the daily grind. We set the screensavers of our computer screens to tropical destinations and imagine lying in the sand with a drink in our hands. If only we were somewhere else, our problems would no longer exist, right? Finally, we book the trip and excitement ensues. However, we soon learn the anticipation was much more exciting than the trip itself as we encounter traveling woes like long lines, crowded places, intense heat and humidity, and mosquitos! Alain de Botton, however, wants to teach you how to travel better. Learn how to take pleasure in small things and change your perspective about common travel discomforts. Instead of groaning about the small, uncomfortable seats on the airplane, think about the miracle of flying through the clouds and seeing the world from a new perspective. With tips from past travelers and philosophers, de Botton will teach you how to appreciate your surroundings and make your traveling experiences more meaningful and memorable.",,['Study Aids'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g1_NDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=g1_NDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Travel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g1_NDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-g1_NDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa,"['Mungo Park', 'James Rennell']","""Until the publication of Park's book in 1799 hardly anything was known of the interior of Africa, apart from the north-east region and coastal areas. Having sent out four expeditions to the Niger, all of which had failed, the African Association in 1795 charged Mungo Park with the task. Park, a Scot. set sail [on 22 May 1795] to find and explore the Niger. Travelling eastward from the English factory at Pisania (where he learned the Mandingo language) along the River Gambia, Park reached the Niger at Segou and followed its course for about one hundred miles to Sulla, where difficulties forced him to turn back [and on being taken ill he returned to England in 1799] ... Park's Travels had an immediate success and was translated into most European languages. It has become a classic of travel literature, and its scientific observations on the botany and meteorology of the region, and on the social and domestic life of the negroes, have remained of lasting value. Park's career was short but he made the first great practical advance in the opening-up of Central Africa. Park did not solve the problem of the Niger: he believed it to be a tributary of the Nile or to be really identical with the Congo; but he set the further exploration of the region in the right direction"" (Printing and the Mind of Man). -- abebooks website",524.0,['Africa'],4.0,3.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Travel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=40&source=gbs_api,"Performed Under the Direction and Patronage of the African Association, in the Years 1795, 1796, and 1797",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-7MkTAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Travels in America and Italy,['Francois-Rene Chateaubriand'],"Originally published in 1828, François René de Chateaubriand's 2-volume Travels in America and Italy is an important literary travel narrative written by a leading (some would say founding) figure of French Romanticism. Chateaubriand traveled to America in 1791 to escape the volatile atmosphere of Revolutionary France. While some doubt has been raised as to whether he actually traveled to all the areas he claimed, (discrepancies in his descriptions of flora and fauna, lead scholars to believe that Chateaubriand did not travel to the Mississippi River, Florida, Alabama, or to Louisiana, as implied by his writing) Chateaubriand's lush descriptions of nature, particularly that of the sparsely populated landscape of the American South, place this work at the forefront of the French Romantic tradition, strongly impacting leading writers and thinkers of the time. Moral and intellectual concerns are explored throughout the work, for example in the Preface that contains his theories of geographical science and the history of travel. The work is also known for its exploration of the customs, manners, and languages of the Native American tribes Chateaubriand encountered. vol. 2 of 2",442.0,['Travel'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BmRJec0QVI0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BmRJec0QVI0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Travel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=45&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Travels in India,['Jean-Baptiste Tavernier'],"Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605-89) was one of the most renowned travelers of 17th century Europe. The son of a French Protestant who had fled Antwerp to escape religious persecution, Tavernier was a jewel merchant who between 1632 and 1668 made six voyages to the East. The countries he visited (most more than once) included present-day Cyprus, Malta, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. In 1676 he published his two-volume Les six voyages de Jean Baptiste Tavernier (The six voyages of Jean Baptiste Tavernier). An abridged and very imperfect English translation of the book appeared in 1677. The first modern scholarly edition in English, presented here, was published in 1889, with translation, notes, and a biographical sketch of Tavernier by Dr. Valentine Ball (1843-95), a British civil servant with the Indian Geological Service. Among the most memorable chapters in the book are those that recount Tavernier's visits to the diamond mines of India and his inspection of the jewels of the Great Mogul. Tavernier was not a scholar or an educated linguist, and after his initial popularity in the 17th century his authority waned, as historians and others questioned the accuracy of his observations. In the 20th century, however, Tavernier's reputation rose, as such important historians as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel used the detailed information he recorded about the prices and qualities of goods and about business and commercial practices in their pioneering studies of economic and social history. The book contains several appendices by Ball about famous diamonds (including the historic Koh-i-Noor Diamond now belonging to the British royal family), diamond mines in India and Borneo, ruby mines in Burma, and sapphire washings in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

Travels in the Mogul Empire,['François Bernier'],"Travels in the Mogul Empire is the first authoritative translation into English of François Bernier's Histoire de la dernière révolution des états du Grand Mogol, published in Paris in 1670-71. Bernier was born at Joué in the Loire, France, and educated in medicine at the University of Montpellier. Desiring to see the world, he traveled to Syria and Palestine in 1654. He returned to the Middle East in 1656, where he lived for a year in Cairo before sailing south through the Red Sea with the intent of making his way to Gondar (in present-day Ethiopia). Upon learning that conditions there were unsafe for travel, he embarked on a ship bound for the port of Surat on the west coast of India. He remained in India for some 12 years, from 1658 to 1669. He initially served as personal physician to Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and the emperor's designated successor, and later worked for Daneshmand Khan, a nobleman in the court of Emperor Aurangzeb. Bernier witnessed firsthand the bloody civil war and succession struggle of 1656-59 in which Aurangzeb, a younger brother of Dara Shikoh, seized the Mughal throne. In 1664 Bernier traveled with Aurangzeb to Kashmir, ""commonly called the paradise of India,"" becoming most likely the first European to visit the province. Bernier wrote several long letters to correspondents in France, in which he gave detailed descriptions of economic conditions and religious and social customs in northern India, including one to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister to King Louis XIV. These letters form part of Travels in the Mogul Empire. Along with his compatriots Jean Chardin (1643-1713) and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605-89), both of whom he met on his travels, Bernier was the source of most of what Europeans knew about India in the late 17th century-early 18th centuries. Bernier was a thinker as well as an adventurer, and the book is replete with excursions on a range of topics, for example, on the nature of atoms, the Lost Tribes of Israel, winds and currents, rains, and the Nile River. There is also an appendix on the history of travel to India. The book contains a preface by the translator, Irving Brock, an English merchant banker who had literary interests.

Melish's Travels,['John Melish'],"In order to provide a """"living picture"""" of America and to entice his fellow countrymen to emigrate to the United States, John Melish published in 1812 his """"Travels through the United States of America, in the years 1806 & 1807, and 1809, 1810, & 1811; including an account of passages betwixt America and Britain, and travels through various parts of Britain, Ireland, & Canada,"""" a work that has come to be seen as an objective portrait of America in the early nineteenth-century. Born in Scotland, where he began his career in the textile industry, Melish visited the United States several times beginning in 1806, finally deciding to settle in Philadelphia in 1811. In the preface to this work, Melish notes: """"as I have always considered books of travels to be very defective when unaccompanied by maps, I have spared no labour, nor expence [sic], to have a good set of maps to illustrate this work."""" These were Melish's first maps, and they formed the basis for his later career in cartography. Reinforcing his observations of the places he visited, these first-hand maps focused on cities, towns, or transportation hubs and included topography and information on local settlements and roads, predominantly covering the Mid-Atlantic and Mid-West. Considered to be some of the best local maps of the time, they were regularly updated with each publication. Melish's maps came to dominate the cartography industry in America, and he set the standard for future American map-makers.",662.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4_hWbgNkzzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4_hWbgNkzzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Travel&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=137&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hindustan and the Panjab,"['William Moorcroft', 'George Trebeck']","William Moorcroft (1767-1825) was a veterinary surgeon who, after maintaining a veterinary practice for a time in London, was engaged in 1807 by the East India Company to manage its breeding of horses. He arrived in India in 1808 and took charge of the company's stud operations at Pusa, Bengal. In 1811 and 1812 he undertook journeys to the northwest in search of larger and better stud horses than he was able to find in India. In July 1812 he crossed the Himalayas to become one of the first Europeans to enter Tibet by this route. By this time, his interests had expanded from the procurement of horses to include the opening of trade relations between Central Asia and Great Britain and the projection of British influence beyond the northwest of British India to counter what he saw as a growing Russian presence in the region. In May 1819 Moorcroft received permission from the East India Company to travel to Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan). He reached the city in February 1825 after a more than five-year journey that took him to Ladakh, Kashmir, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, into Afghanistan via the Khyber Pass, and through Kabul and Kunduz to his ultimate destination. He began his return journey to India in July 1825, but died of fever in Balkh, Afghanistan, on August 27. Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hindustan and the Panjab is Moorcroft's account of his journey of 1819-25. It was posthumously edited and published by Horace Wilson, professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, based on Moorcroft's voluminous notebooks and correspondence. Volume one is devoted entirely to Moorcroft's journey to and residence in Ladakh. Volume two completes the account of Moorcroft's time in Ladakh and recounts his journey to Kashmir, Kabul, and Bukhara.

Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse,"['Sarah Tarlow', 'Emma Battell Lowman']","This open access book is the culmination of many years of research on what happened to the bodies of executed criminals in the past. Focusing on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it looks at the consequences of the 1752 Murder Act. These criminal bodies had a crucial role in the history of medicine, and the history of crime, and great symbolic resonance in literature and popular culture. Starting with a consideration of the criminal corpse in the medieval and early modern periods, chapters go on to review the histories of criminal justice, of medical history and of gibbeting under the Murder Act, and ends with some discussion of the afterlives of the corpse, in literature, folklore and in contemporary medical ethics. Using sophisticated insights from cultural history, archaeology, literature, philosophy and ethics as well as medical and crime history, this book is a uniquely interdisciplinary take on a fascinating historical phenomenon.",273.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bC1bDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bC1bDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA218&dq=True+Crime&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=49&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bC1bDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-bC1bDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Ring and the Book,['Robert Browning'],"This is the first edition of The Ring and the Book published by Smith, Elder & Company in 1868. Robert Browning's long blank-verse poem consists of 12 books and over 20,000 lines and was published in four separate volumes. This first volume includes ""The Ring and the Book,"" ""Half-Rome"" and ""The Other Half-Rome."" The verse-novel, which tells the story of a murder case that actually occurred in 17th-century Rome, showcases Browning's famous use of dramatic monologue. Ten of the 12 books are in the form of dramatic monologues--nine of them from different narrators. The first and last books in the series are told from the author's point of view.

The Consolation of Philosophy,['Boethius'],"'Why else does slippery Fortune change So much, and punishment more fit For crime oppress the innocent?' Written in prison before his brutal execution in AD 524, Boethius's The Consolation of Philosophy is a conversation between the ailing prisoner and his 'nurse' Philosophy, whose instruction restores him to health and brings him to enlightenment. Boethius was an eminent public figure who had risen to great political heights in the court of King Theodoric when he was implicated in conspiracy and condemned to death. Although a Christian, it was to the pagan Greek philosophers that he turned for inspiration following his abrupt fall from grace. With great clarity of thought and philosophical brilliance, Boethius adopted the classical model of the dialogue to debate the vagaries of Fortune, and to explore the nature of happiness, good and evil, fate and free will. This edition includes an introduction discussing Boethius's life and writings, a bibliography, glossary and notes.",304.0,['Happiness'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L-M9AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=L-M9AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=True+Crime&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=339&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L-M9AQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-L-M9AQAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Transmission of the Ocular Media,"['Edward A. Boettner', 'J. Reimer Wolter']","The spectral transmittance of ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared light through the ocular media of humans has been measured. Using freshly enucleated eyes, the transmittances of each component part (cornea, aqueous humor, lens, vitreous humor) were determined for the wavelength range from 0.22 to 2.8 microns. To date 9 eyes have been measured, ranging in age from 4 weeks to 75 years. Two types of measurements were made: the first to measure the total light transmitted (direct and scattered) at each wavelength and the second to measure the percent transmittance of that light passing directly through the various media without absorption or scattering.

My Big Toe,['Thomas Campbell'],"""Based upon careful scientific research and logical deduction, this is a trilogy for all who have an interest in the nature of the reality in which they exist. My Big TOE is not only about scientific theory, function, and process--a discovery of Big Picture science--but also speaks to each individual reader about his or her innate capabilities. Readers will learn how to evolve their human potential far beyond the limitations of the physical universe. My Big TOE is about life, purpose, personal significance, physics, evolution, and the reason why. The acronym ""TOE"" is a standard term in the physics community that stands for ""Theory Of Everything."" Such a theory has been the ""Holy Grail"" of physicists for more than fifty years. My Big TOE delivers the solution to that scientific quest at the layman's level with precision and clarity. This book is an adventure into the overlapping worlds of science, philosophy, and metaphysics. It is tightly analytical and logical as all good works of science and philosophy should be, while at the same time down to earth, easily understandable, and full of good humor. No leaps of faith or beliefs of any sort are required to get to where these books will take you. Campbell did not put the ""My"" in My Big TOE to flaunt pride of authorship. Nor does the ""My"" indicate any lack of generality or applicability to others. The ""My"" was added to be a constant reminder to you that this reality model cannot serve as your personal Big TOE until it is based upon your personal experience. On the other hand, personal or subjective experience is only one piece of the reality puzzle. In the objective physical world of traditional science, My Big TOE delivers a comprehensive model of reality that subsumes modern science, describes our objective material reality, and is universally applicable.

Lord Bacon's Essays,['Francis Bacon'],"""This book was written to furnish to the English student the best practicable substitute for classical training. We have many valuable works about the English language and literature, and enough of instruction about how to interpret what we read. To give a higher value to these, we need critically to read and interpret more good English in our schools. For these purposes, no book seems better adapted, as a foundation, than Lord Bacon's Essays--abounding in classical learning, in occasional great felicities of style, in solid, weighty, and ingenious thought; also in forms of expression antiquated, obsolete and obscure; in sentences sometimes elegant, sometimes decidedly the reverse, and these, in many instances, not well arranged as to length or structure, or distribution into paragraphs of suitable length. On these, and other accounts, these Essays are admirably adapted for critical purposes, for the culture of judgment and taste, for the comparison of older forms of expression with those approved at the present day, and as a preparation for the intelligent and appreciative reading of the great English authors of the seventeenth century, so rich in thought, in learning, and in genius. This edition annotates all those essays which are considered as decidedly the most valuable. In preparing this work, a free use has been made of Archbishop Whately's edition, and especially of his annotations. To these essays is added the Sketch of the Life and Character of Lord Francis Bacon, a review of his philosophical writings by Hallam, Macauley, Craik and MacFarlane, and Devy, and a critical estimation of Bacon's essays by Beattie, Hallam, Macauley, Archbiship Whatley, Stweart, and Reed""--Introduction.

The Federalist,Unknown,"The Federalist is considered the most important work on statecraft and political theory ever written by Americans. Seventy-seven of the 85 essays that make up the work appeared in New York newspapers between October 1787 and May 1788 under the pseudonym ""Publius."" The eight additional essays first appeared in the second volume of the work presented here, and in the newspapers later in 1788. Principally written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, with some assistance from John Jay, the primary purpose of the essays was to convince the citizens of New York to elect to a state ratifying convention delegates who would favor the new United States Constitution, adopted in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. The essays were rushed into print in book form in two volumes in the spring of 1788, numbers 1-39 as volume 1 on March 22, and numbers 40-85 as volume 2 on May 28. Together these essays, often referred to as The Federalist Papers, form one of the great classics of government, the principal themes of which are federalism, checks and balances, separated powers, pluralism, and popular representation. In part because Hamilton and Madison were important participants in the Philadelphia convention, The Federalist became the most authoritative interpretation of what the drafters of the Constitution intended, one that continues to influence the development and interpretation of American constitutional law. Presented here is Thomas Jefferson's personal copy of the first edition of The Federalist, with notes in his hand indicating his understanding regarding the authorship of each essay. Hamilton left an authorship list with his lawyer before his fatal duel with Aaron Burr, and Madison identified the writer of each essay in his copy of The Federalist. None of these lists agree, and authorship of some of the essays is still being debated by scholars. The New York convention met in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 and on July 26 voted in favor of ratification by the narrow margin of 30 to 27.",224.0,['Constitutional history'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NiBAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NiBAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Essays&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=257&source=gbs_api,"A Collection of Essays, Written in Favour of the New Constitution, as Agreed Upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NiBAAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-NiBAAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

A Credible Utopia,['Peter Valente'],"A Credible Utopia: Essays on Selected Films of Werner Schroeter offers unique and personal insights into Schroeter's cinematic universe. Many of the films discussed in this book are those upon which Schroeter's worldwide reputation rests: Der Bomberpilot, an absurdist comedy; The Death of Maria Malibran, a film about ecstatic redemption in death; Willow Springs, about the complex relationships between men and women; Day of the Idiots, a visually baroque, operatic and highly dramatic film about madness; The Kingdom of Naples, Schroeter's visually stunning depiction of Italy in the post-war years; and Palermo or Wolfsburg, for which Schroeter won the Golden Bear, an epic film about love, violence, and cultural malaise. But Valente also addresses Schroeter's early experimental films that don't get as much attention, such as Aggression, Neurasia, and Argila, all of which are about the struggle between repression and desire, and Deux, a late work that Schroeter considered his masterpiece, a film about the double and the ways in which identity is formed by integrating the abject part of ourselves with the good. Valente concludes with an analysis of Nuit de Chien, Schroeter's final film, a powerful summation of a live devoted to art, music, literature, and film. When the Museum of Modern Art staged a retrospective of Schroeter's ouevre in 2012, there was hardly anything in English on his films and only one film available on DVD in the US, such that Schroeter's work as a director has remained largely invisible in the English-speaking world. A Credible Utopia repairs this lacuna in film history, and, in a detailed and intimate reading of Schroeter's queer ouevre, links all these films together through Schroeter's desire for a ""credible utopia,"" despite our shared awareness of disaster, torture, viciousness, and political corruption in the world. Peter Valente is a writer, translator, and author of twelve books, including a translation of Nanni Balestrini's Blackout (Commune Editions, 2017), which received a starred review in Publisher's Weekly. His most recent book is Essays on the Peripheries (punctum books, 2021).

Essays on Paula Rego: Smile When You Think about Hell,['Maria Manuel Lisboa'],"In these powerful and stylishly written essays, Maria Manuel Lisboa dissects the work of Paula Rego, the Portuguese-born artist considered one of the greatest artists of modern times. Focusing primarily on Rego’s work since the 1980s, Lisboa explores the complex relationships between violence and nurturing, power and impotence, politics and the family that run through Rego’s art. Taking a historicist approach to the evolution of the artist’s work, Lisboa embeds the works within Rego’s personal history as well as Portugal’s (and indeed other nations’) stories, and reveals the interrelationship between political significance and the raw emotion that lies at the heart of Rego’s uncompromising iconographic style. Fundamental to Lisboa’s analysis is an understanding that apparent opposites – male and female, sacred and profane, aggression and submissiveness – often co-exist in Rego’s work in a way that is both disturbing and destabilising. This collection of essays brings together both unpublished and previously published work to make a significant contribution to scholarship about Paula Rego. It will also be of interest to scholars and students of contemporary painting, Portuguese and British feminist art, and the political and ideological aspects of the visual arts.",510.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1rmxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1rmxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Essays&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=340&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1rmxDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-1rmxDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Naval Leadership in the Atlantic World,"['Richard Harding', 'Agustín Guimerá']","The naval leader has taken centre stage in traditional naval histories. However, while the historical narrative has been fairly consistent the development of various navies has been accompanied by assumptions, challenges and competing visions of the social characteristics of naval leaders and of their function. Whilst leadership has been a constant theme in historical studies, it has not been scrutinised as a phenomenon in its own right. This book examines the critical period in Europe between 1700 -1850, when political, economic and cultural shifts were bringing about a new understanding of the individual and of society. Bringing together context with a focus on naval leadership as a phenomenon is at the heart of this book, a unique collaborative venture between British, French and Spanish scholars. As globalisation develops in the twenty-first century the significance of navies looks set to increase. This volume of essays aims to place naval leadership in its historical context. An electronic version of this book is freely available, thanks to the support of libraries working with Knowledge Unlatched.

The Struggle of the Shi‘is in Indonesia,['Zulkifli'],"The Struggle of the Shi‘is in Indonesia is a pioneering work. It is the first comprehensive scholarly examination in English of the development of Shiism in Indonesia. It focuses primarily on the important period between 1979 and 2004 – a period of nearly a quarter of a century that saw the notable dissemination of Shi’i ideas and a considerable expansion of the number of Shi’i adherents in Indonesia. Since Islam in Indonesia is overwhelmingly Sunni, this development of Shiism in a predominantly Sunni context is a remarkable phenomenon that calls for careful, critical investigation. There is also an important examination of the principal ideas underlying the Madhab Ahl al-Bayt, the Imamate and Imam Madhi, Ja‘fari jurisprudence and ritual piety. Appropriately, in his discussion, Zulkifli provides a succinct outline of contrasts with Sunni ideas and practice. He also examines the publishing efforts that underpinned the dissemination of Shi’i ideas and the founding of IJABI (Ikatan Jamaah Ahlul Bait Indonesia) in July 2000 for the propagation of Ahl al-Bayt teachings. Given the Indonesian context, Zulkifli is also concerned with Sunni reactions to these Shi’i developments – a story that continues to unfold to the present. This book as a work of great value and significance for the continuing understanding of the richness and complexity of Indonesian Islam.",328.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IbhIAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=IbhIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Essays&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=602&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Security Guide for IBM i V6.1,"['Jim Cook', 'Juan Carlos Cantalupo', 'MinHoon Lee', 'IBM Redbooks']","The IBM® i operation system (formerly IBM i5/OS®) is considered one of the most secure systems in the industry. From the beginning, security was designed as an integral part of the system. The System i® platform provides a rich set of security features and services that pertain to the goals of authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and auditing. However, if an IBM Client does not know that a service, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or hardware cryptographic support, exists on the system, it will not use it.

Guide for the linguistic inclusion of migrants,['Lorna Carson'],"Designed to create tangible materials which support the demands of this context, the INCLUDEED Erasmus+ project aims to integrate migrants and refugees through one of Europe’s greatest assets - their languages. This guide aims to become an ally of both those who wish to deepen their knowledge of the migration phenomenon and those who wish to facilitate the integration process of these groups. Developed from the experience that the Universities of the consortium have in this field (University of Salamanca, University of Bologna, University of Coimbra, University of Heidelberg, University of Poitiers and Trinity College Dublin), this document emanates from a common effort as well as from the will to form an egalitarian society in terms of integration. However, this would not have been possible without the support of various non-governmental organisations (Red Cross, ACCEM, CEPAIM Foundation and Sierra-Pambley Foundation) which, dedicated to the reception and integration of migrants and refugees throughout Europe, have facilitated the identification of difficulties and enabled bridges to be built between different perspectives and joint efforts to converge in the same direction. This guide addresses the various challenges that emerge during the integration period of these groups and proposes solutions that can help this complex process to be successful. Designed as a useful vade mecum for the performance of the tasks of the various groups (language teaching professionals or volunteers, non-governmental organisations and national and supranational public institutions), it is a support tool that guides the actions of those involved in the process of linguistic integration of newly arrived people. It provides them with a better understanding of the situation in which these groups find themselves and of the tools available to achieve this. In short, it is a document that seeks to bring together, through informative but rigorous text, the theoretical advances in this field and to offer various resources that can be put into practice in real life. Finally, we would like to emphasise that the contents of this guide should be understood as suggestions arising from the experience and commitment of those who have worked on its development and as a tool that will help to answer some of the questions that arise in the process of integration of migrant groups. These questions are currently being answered thanks to the committed engagement of all those who are participating in this project. In addition, information from all the countries in the consortium can be found throughout these pages, which broadens the perspective of most of the tools created so far, making this guide truly an international reference work.",182.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jliYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jliYEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=72&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jliYEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jliYEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Crossley ID Guide,['Richard Crossley'],"A revolution in birding and field guides This stunningly illustrated book from acclaimed birder and photographer Richard Crossley revolutionizes field guide design by providing the first real-life approach to identification. Whether you are a beginner, expert, or anywhere in between, The Crossley ID Guide will vastly improve your ability to identify birds. Unlike other guides, which provide isolated individual photographs or illustrations, this is the first book to feature large, lifelike scenes for each species. These scenes—640 in all—are composed from more than 10,000 of the author's images showing birds in a wide range of views--near and far, from different angles, in various plumages and behaviors, including flight, and in the habitat in which they live. These beautiful compositions show how a bird's appearance changes with distance, and give equal emphasis to characteristics experts use to identify birds: size, structure and shape, behavior, probability, and color. This is the first book to convey all of these features visually--in a single image--and to reinforce them with accurate, concise text. Each scene provides a wealth of detailed visual information that invites and rewards careful study, but the most important identification features can be grasped instantly by anyone. By making identification easier, more accurate, and more fun than ever before, The Crossley ID Guide will completely redefine how its users look at birds. Essential for all birders, it also promises to make new birders of many people who have despaired of using traditional guides. Revolutionary.

A Guide to Sugarbush Stocking Based on the Crown Diameter/D.b.h. Relationship of Open-grown Sugar Maples,"['H. Clay Smith', 'Carter B.

(diameter breast high) of open-grown sugar maple trees (Acer saccharurn Marsh.). We found a strong relationship between crown diameter and d.b.h., and converted these data into stocking guides for various stand-size classes. The stocking guide are based on the assumption that trees with full crowns produce the best sap yields.

Risk Management in Elections,"['Amy Vincent, Sead Alihodzic, Stephen Gale']","When electoral risks are not understood and addressed, they can undermine the credibility of the process and the results it yields. Electoral management bodies (EMBs) encounter numerous risks across all phases of the electoral cycle. They operate in environments that are increasingly complex and volatile and where factors such as technology, demographics, insecurity, inaccurate or incomplete information and natural calamities, create increasing uncertainty. The experiences of EMBs show that when formal risk management processes are successfully implemented, the benefits are profound. Greater risk awareness helps organizations to focus their resources on where they are most needed, thus achieving cost-effectiveness. Over the last decade it has been observed that EMBs are increasingly moving from informal to formal risk management processes. The purpose of this Guide is to lay out a set of practical steps for EMBs on how to establish or advance their risk management framework.

Lumsden of the Guides,"['Sir Peter Stark Lumsden', 'G. R. Elsmie']","Lumsden of the Guides is a biography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Burnett Lumsden (1821-96), co-authored by his younger brother, General Sir Peter Stark Lumsden (1829-1918) and George R. Elsmie (1838-1909), a judge and writer in British India. Harry Lumsden was a soldier in the army of the British East India Company who was part of the Anglo-Indian force that occupied Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-42). He subsequently held posts on the North-West Frontier of India and in 1857-58 undertook a mission to Kandahar to ascertain whether the Afghan ruler Dost Mohammad Khan was adhering to the terms of a treaty that required the Afghans, in exchange for British subsidies, to maintain their defenses against Persia in the region of Herat. The ""guides"" of the title refers to the corps of guides, locally recruited soldiers that the British used to defend the frontiers of India from attacks and uprisings by warlike tribes hostile to British rule. Lumsden recruited and commanded this force at different times in his career, beginning in 1846. The book covers Lumsden's background and education and his military career and diplomatic missions. Three appendices consist of unpublished writings by Harry Lumsden, including sections from a notebook entitled ""Frontier Thoughts and Frontier Requirements"" concerning all aspects of the recruitment and command of the guides; an essay entitled ""A Few Notes on Afghan Field-Sports"" dealing with hawking, hunting, and related subjects; and a few pages of recollections of the march from Peshawar to Jalalabad in 1842. The book is illustrated with drawings and photographs and contains a fold-out map of the Afghan frontier with an inset of the route from Kandahar to Herat. Peter Stark Lumsden was also a distinguished soldier in the Indian army. He accompanied his brother on the Kandahar mission of 1857-58 and in the 1880s headed the Anglo-Indian side of the Joint Boundary Commission formed with Russia to define the northern border of Afghanistan.",396.0,['India'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aYBCAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aYBCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=251&source=gbs_api,"A Sketch of the Life of Lieut.-Gen.

It explains why valuations are important, where and when they should be used, and by whom. It is not intended to be a valuation textbook;, instead it seeks to raise the level of awareness of valuation issues and procedures among those involved in land policy and administration and those affected by land tenure decisions. Though this Technical Guide focuses on land, it provides useful guidance that may be applied to fisheries, forests and other natural resources. It is directed prim arily towards developing countries and countries in transition where there is less awareness of the valuation profession and institutions.

Drawing from global evidence, literature, and survey data, this volume provides a framework to elucidate issues and trade-offs in UBI with a view to help inform choices around its appropriateness and feasibility in different contexts. Specifically, the book examines how UBI differs from or complements other social assistance programs in terms of objectives, coverage, incidence, adequacy, incentives, effects on poverty and inequality, financing, political economy, and implementation.

Performance Optimization and Tuning Techniques for IBM Power Systems Processors Including IBM POWER8,"['Brian Hall', 'Peter Bergner', 'Alon Shalev Housfater', 'Madhusudanan Kandasamy', 'Tulio Magno', 'Alex Mericas', 'Steve Munroe', 'Mauricio Oliveira', 'Bill Schmidt', 'Will Schmidt', 'Bernard King Smith', 'Julian Wang', 'Suresh Warrier', 'David Wendt', 'IBM Redbooks']","This IBM® Redbooks® publication focuses on gathering the correct technical information, and laying out simple guidance for optimizing code performance on IBM POWER8® processor-based systems that run the IBM AIX®, IBM i, or Linux operating systems. There is straightforward performance optimization that can be performed with a minimum of effort and without extensive previous experience or in-depth knowledge. The POWER8 processor contains many new and important performance features, such as support for eight hardware threads in each core and support for transactional memory. The POWER8 processor is a strict superset of the IBM POWER7+TM processor, and so all of the performance features of the POWER7+ processor, such as multiple page sizes, also appear in the POWER8 processor. Much of the technical information and guidance for optimizing performance on POWER8 processors that is presented in this guide also applies to POWER7+ and earlier processors, except where the guide explicitly indicates that a feature is new in the POWER8 processor. This guide strives to focus on optimizations that tend to be positive across a broad set of IBM POWER® processor chips and systems. Specific guidance is given for the POWER8 processor; however, the general guidance is applicable to the IBM POWER7+, IBM POWER7®, IBM POWER6®, IBM POWER5, and even to earlier processors. This guide is directed at personnel who are responsible for performing migration and implementation activities on POWER8 processor-based systems. This includes system administrators, system architects, network administrators, information architects, and database administrators (DBAs).",274.0,['Computers'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ph0CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7ph0CgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=285&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ph0CgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-7ph0CgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Captioning and Subtitling for d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing Audiences,['Soledad Zárate'],"Captioning and Subtitling for d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing Audiences is a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of captioning and subtitling, a discipline that has evolved quickly in recent years. This guide is of a practical nature and contains examples and exercises at the end of each chapter. Some of the tasks stimulate reflection on the practice and reception, while others focus on particular captioning and SDH areas, such as paralinguistic features, music and sound effects. The requirements of d/Deaf and hard of hearing audiences are analysed in detail and are accompanied by linguistic and technical considerations. These considerations, though shared with generic subtitling parameters, are discussed specifically with d/Deaf and hard of hearing audiences in mind. The reader will become familiar with the characteristics of d/Deaf and hard of hearing audiences, and the diversity – including cultural and linguistic differences – within this group of people. Based on first-hand experience in the field, the book also provides a step-by-step guide to making live performances accessible to d/Deaf and hard of hearing audiences. As well as exploring all linguistic and technical matters related to the creation of captions, aspects related to the overall set up of the captioned performance are discussed. The guide will be valuable reading to students of audiovisual translation at undergraduate and postgraduate level, to professional subtitlers and captioners, and to any organisation or venue that engages with d/Deaf and hard of hearing people.",176.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ymceEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ymceEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=327&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ymceEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ymceEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

With his extensive knowledge of philosophy and numerous philosophers and his familiarity with current science, Rod is able to guide the reader through the development of thought in these disciplines and shows us the place that Sri Aurobindo has staked out for us as the enlightened forerunner he was. These lectures are not a difficult or tedious ascent to airless heights, rather, they are instructive explorations of the broader base camps surrounding the mount; it is left to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother to guide us in our ascent.

Vietnamese Pronunciation,['Nguyen Dang Liem'],"This is the first in the PALI Language Text series to deal with a Southeast Asian language. The author's approach in this pronunciation guide owes much to the methodology pioneered by Charles Fries. A basic assumption of this approach is that in learning a new language the problem is not first of all learning vocabulary but ""mastery of the sound system."" Moreover, the problems of learning a new sound system vary with the native language of the student.

The way you see the problem is the problem, so you must allow yourself to fundamentally change the way you think in order to see a true change in yourself. Covey will not only teach you how to adopt a new mindset, but he will also teach you how to become proactive and focus on the important tasks at hand.

Worship in Spirit and in Truth,['Bode Ososami'],"Bode's new book offers fresh, bold and uncommon frankness in reexamining our approach to Worship. It presents no-nonsense truths only for those unafraid to confront the status quo on biblical worship. It has a chapter especially on how musical entertainment, described by Leonard Ravenhill as ""The joy of the devil"", has played the role of the ""Trojan Horse"" to wreak havoc in the Worship service. This book also explains current leadership trends in the United States and how new tolerance on spiritual matters gradually prepared the ground for what is now inevitably mirrored as unforeseen and shocking decay on the social scene. The way back is not just to plead the undisputable truths that ""Abortion is Murder"" or "" ...no sodomites of the sons of Israel"" as these are ""forever settled"" issues not requiring our special advocacy, but moreso to cleanse His House and return back to God in all spheres. We can then enjoy partnering with God as we watch Him win His battles. It is written in 5 parts. Parts I to 4 are teachings to reestablish the Biblical meaning of worship and cover topics such as Who and what are we to worship? What is Worship? Who are to Worship in His Presence? Why Worship? Important Themes and expressions of Heavenly Worship;Breakthrough in Worship. Part 5 describes modern trends in entertainment/ music forms and styles introduced into worship and how they complement the current subtle deviations from divine patterns and God given doctrines. The book concludes on a call back to God and includes a Personal and Group Study Guide for individuals, churches, worship leaders and Group Learning. Bode is also author of ""Wealth out of Ashes"" - a Biblical commentary and response to the current Global Economic Crises for those seeking a different angle.",217.0,['Christian life'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qd-bMXwiFkwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qd-bMXwiFkwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=485&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Fuel and Financial Savings for Operators of Small Fishing Vessels,"['J. D. K. Wilson', 'Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations']","Fishing continues to be the most energy-intensive food production method in the world today, and it depends almost completely upon oil fuel-based internal combustion engines. There are as yet no signs of any other energy source that could substitute the internal combustion engine in either the medium or short term. The industry continues to be exposed to global fuel prices and it cannot be assumed that these will remain stable indefinitely. Small-scale fisheries account for nearly half of the world's fish production and, although they are generally more labour-intensive than larger industrial fisheries, they are increasingly affected by energy costs. In developing countries, in spite of the energy conservation initiatives of the 1980s (subsequent to the dramatic rise in the cost of fossil fuels), mechanization continues to increase. Fuel costs have ever more influence not only on consumer prices but also on fishermen's and boat owners' net incomes. When levels of employment and cost-sharing systems are considered, it becomes even more important from a social perspective to improve and maintain energy efficiency within small-scale fisheries. This guide presents information on the key technical areas that affect energy efficiency, but only part of the information presented herein will be applicable to any particular fishing situation. The guide is not a result of new original fieldwork but draws on much of the research and experience of the past two decades, updated where possible to include new technical developments. The guide is divided into two major sections: the first relates to changes in operational techniques rather than changes in technology; the second presents information of relevance to vessel operators who are either considering the construction of a new vessel or overhauling and re-equipping an existing vessel.",60.0,['Fisheries'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qKtM8ghqek4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qKtM8ghqek4C&pg=PP1&dq=Guide&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=582&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Effective Media Communication During Public Health Emergencies,['World Health Organization'],"Effective communication through the media is an essential responsibility of public health officials, particularly during emergencies. Urgent high-concern situations present a unique communication challenge. Recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, releases of anthrax and sarin, and the tsunami disaster in South-east Asia underline the importance of communication during public health emergencies. Poor communication can erode public support, fan emotions, undermine confidence, and amplify social and economic costs. Effective communication can rally support, calm a nervous public, provide much-needed information, encourage cooperative behaviors, and help save lives. This handbook presents an integrated principle-based approach to media communication for those dealing with public health emergencies. Topics covered include how journalists gather and process information about public health emergencies, steps for planning and implementing an effective media communication program, identifying and reaching target audiences, conducting media interviews, avoiding traps and pitfalls, and preparing key messages. It is designed to improve those skills needed for preparing and delivering public health messages during an emergency. It will be useful to public health and government officials, senior managers in public and private sector organizations, hospital managers, public information officers, and experts responsible for communicating with the media. The Field Guide produced as a separate book summarizes the practical steps that can be taken to strengthen and enhance efforts made in this area.

Religious Environmental Activism in Asia,['Leslie E.

Religion and spirituality have the potential to be extremely influential for the better at many levels and in many ways through their intellectual, emotional, and activist components. This collection focuses on providing a set of captivating essays on the specifics of concrete cases of environmental activism involving most of the main Asian religions from several countries. Particular case studies are drawn from the religions of Animism, Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, Islam, and Jainism. They are from the countries of Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Thereby this set of case studies offers a very substantial and rich sampling of religious environmental activism in Asia. They are grounded in years of original field research on the subjects covered. Collectively these case studies reveal a fascinating and significant movement of environmental initiatives in engaged practical spiritual ecology in Asia. Accordingly, this collection should be of special interest to a diversity of scientists, academics, instructors, and students as well as communities and leaders from a wide variety of religions, environmentalism, and conservation.",194.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hwHcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hwHcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=7&source=gbs_api,Case Studies in Spiritual Ecology,No link available
Spiritualism's Impact on Contemporary Religion & Belief,['Cometan'],"With church attendance in the UK taking dramatic reductions over the last twenty years, the contemporary context for religiosity and spirituality would seem to be in a dire state. However, exploring beyond the surface level of church attendance, we come to discover a significant diversification of both religious practice and spiritual belief that is navigating a rapidly changing world and a world in which moral values have shifted in the opposite direction to Church dogma. Spiritualism, and its many facets, is a key player in this “spiritual shift” towards less organised forms of religion, the consequences of which will dramatically impact the British religious landscape of the 21st century. This “spiritual shift” is characterised by a wide set of alternative beliefs that hold long histories of persecution at the hands of the Church. Furthermore, demographers are challenged to try and quantify the deep complexities of people’s beliefs that are not accurately grasped through each decade’s general census. Despite how a person may identify themselves in the census, this tragically misses out the complexity of religious belief and attitudes regarding more specific questions and therefore tells demographers very little about the true religious landscape. Accepting these shortcomings of modern demographic data on religiosity, demonstrates that the data we have likely represents only a narrow understanding of the reality of religious and spiritual life. This understanding has not been helped by the diversification and individualisation of religious beliefs as well as the fast-changing nature of digital religion. In this essay, the historical background and present-day role of spiritualism in British society will be investigated with the central aim of taking an in-depth look at the social context of spiritualism’s presence in Britain, the commercialisation of spiritualism and how both technology and changes in social values are being navigated by spiritualists. This analysis will particularly focus on the role of women in spiritualism and the rise in acceptance of LGBTQ groups in society as important factors effecting not only the rise of spiritualism, but the British religious landscape as a whole. Firstly, it is important to consider where spiritualism originated in order to understand its contemporary presence.",10.0,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ajBcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ajBcEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=8&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Measures of Spirituality/Religiosity—Description of Concepts and Validation of Instruments,['Arndt Büssing'],"Why do we need more questionnaires to measure aspects of spirituality/religiosity when we already have so many well-tried instruments in use? One answer is that research in this field is growing and that new research questions continuously do arise. Several of these new questions cannot be easily answered with the instruments designed for previous questions. The field is expanding and, consequently, the research topics. Meanwhile several multidimensional instruments were developed which cover existential, prosocial, religious and non-religious forms of spirituality, hope, peace and trust—and several more. The ‘disadvantage’ of these instruments is the fact that some are conceptually broad and often rather unspecific, but they might be suited quite well for culturally and spiritually diverse populations when the intention is to compare such diverse groups. This is the reason why more research on new instruments is needed as can be found in this Special Issue, and to stimulate a critical debate about their pros and cons.",148.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dy-UDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dy-UDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=9&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Addressing new topics in health research also relies on standardized questionnaires. The number of instruments intended to measure specific aspects of spirituality is growing, and it is particularly difficult to evaluate the new instruments. This Special Issue will focus on some of the established instruments (updating them to different languages and cultures), but will also describe the features and intentions of newly-developed instruments, which may potentially be used in larger studies to develop knowledge relevant to spiritual care and practice. This Special Issue will serve as a resource on the instruments used to study the wide range of organized religiosity, the individual experience of the divine, and an open approach in the search for meaning and purpose in life.",180.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AKOWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AKOWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=10&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Modernism and the Spiritual in Russian Art,"['Louise Hardiman', 'Nicola Kozicharow']","In 1911 Vasily Kandinsky published the first edition of ‘On the Spiritual in Art’, a landmark modernist treatise in which he sought to reframe the meaning of art and the true role of the artist. For many artists of late Imperial Russia – a culture deeply influenced by the regime’s adoption of Byzantine Orthodoxy centuries before – questions of religion and spirituality were of paramount importance. As artists and the wider art community experimented with new ideas and interpretations at the dawn of the twentieth century, their relationship with ‘the spiritual’ – broadly defined – was inextricably linked to their roles as pioneers of modernism. This diverse collection of essays introduces new and stimulating approaches to the ongoing debate as to how Russian artistic modernism engaged with questions of spirituality in the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Ten chapters from emerging and established voices offer new perspectives on Kandinsky and other familiar names, such as Kazimir Malevich, Mikhail Larionov, and Natalia Goncharova, and introduce less well-known figures, such as the Georgian artists Ucha Japaridze and Lado Gudiashvili, and the craftswoman and art promoter Aleksandra Pogosskaia. Prefaced by a lively and informative introduction by Louise Hardiman and Nicola Kozicharow that sets these perspectives in their historical and critical context, Modernism and the Spiritual in Russian Art: New Perspectives enriches our understanding of the modernist period and breaks new ground in its re-examination of the role of religion and spirituality in the visual arts in late Imperial Russia. Of interest to historians and enthusiasts of Russian art, culture, and religion, and those of international modernism and the avant-garde, it offers innovative readings of a history only partially explored, revealing uncharted corners and challenging long-held assumptions.",320.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=20&source=gbs_api,New Perspectives,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-k44-DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Religion and Agriculture,['J. Lindsay Falvey'],"Religion is a powerful expression of culture that is most obviously expressed in our relationships with nature. As our major meeting point with nature is food, this provides a fertile field for cultivating the wisdom that Professor Falvey concludes is the essence of all sustainability. By bringing sustainability, agriculture, global issues, Buddhism, Christianity and a host of other factors into play, we see that our motivations belie our rhetoric -- in environmental actions through to trade and aid. This open-spirited book contains a wealth of analysis and alternative logics that make it essential to serious readers about nature, the environment, spirituality and religion, Asia and ourselves. Beginning with science and spirituality, the discussion moves from immortality to theology to literal misinterpretations and unifies these themes around unacknowledged Western core values. Shifting to philosophy, ethics, and rights, an ecological argument about our selective 'liberation' of nature is proffered as an introduction to global issues, including traditional values of poor countries and lost traditions in the West. An engrossing hybrid Oriental-Western dialectic allows chapters to be read alone or as part of an accumulating thesis. Thus Buddhist and Christian teachings are applied to agriculture and sustainability -- and they are found to be at one with each other. Whether it is biblical metaphor, karmic logic or enlightened self-interest, the continuous thread of a strong suture stitches a complex set of subjects into a coherent sutra that will vivify the current moribund dialogue between agriculture, science and religion. -- back cover.",290.0,['Agriculture'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w8FVgzDItKgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w8FVgzDItKgC&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=22&source=gbs_api,Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w8FVgzDItKgC&rdid=book-w8FVgzDItKgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Sacred & the Digital,['F.G. (Frank) Bosman'],"Video game studies are a relative young but flourishing academic discipline. But within game studies, however, the perspective of religion and spirituality is rather neglected, both by game scholars and religion scholars. While religion can take different shapes in digital games, ranging from material and referential to reflexive and ritual, it is not necessarily true that game developers depict their in-game religions in a positive, confirming way, but ever so often games approach the topic critically and disavowingly. The religion criticisms found in video games can be categorized as follows: religion as (1) fraud, aimed to manipulate the uneducated, as (2) blind obedience towards an invisible but ultimately non-existing deity/ies, as (3) violence against those who do not share the same set of religious rules, as (4) madness, a deranged alternative for logical reasoning, and as (5) suppression in the hands of the powerful elite to dominate and subdue the masses into submission and obedience.

Working with Oneness,['Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee'],"Humanity has been given access to the secrets of oneness, but we need to learn how to work with them. Working with Oneness brings mysticism into the center of the marketplace, into the world of business and technology, and shows how we can work with it in everyday life. The dynamic energy of oneness has the potential to heal the planet and revolutionize life more than we can imagine, but it requires our individual participation and awareness to become fully alive. The energy of oneness is already present but waiting to be lived, and Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee provides a blueprint for working consciously with this energy. As we understand how our consciousness affects the whole fabric of life, the potential for real global change comes alive. Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee stresses the need to change from hierarchical, patriarchal power structures to organic patterns that allow for the free flow of energy and ideas. Through these patterns the dynamic energy of oneness can become part of everyday life. Working with Oneness includes a number of additional important topics, including: the changing energy structure of the planet and how to work with it; the power of individual consciousness; the danger of the desire for spiritual security; the return of joy to everyday life; the awakening of the heart of the world; a new understanding of magic; the use of the imagination; and mystical participation in life with the energy of oneness. Working with Oneness offers guidance on how to work with the energy of oneness, to learn how to participate in life free of the patterns of the past, so that the divine can come alive in every moment of every day. Working with Oneness is mystical activism at its most potent. “There is a growing and eager audience waiting for a vision of unity consciousness... Working with Oneness offers a salutary antidote to worn-out antagonisms. It challenges readers to join other kindred souls in a mystical activism that can bring new hope to humanity.” —Spirituality & Health “A book filled with wonder and the kind of insights that can leap out to your heart and gladden you for having read them. It's words are simple and straightforward—always a blessing—but its message it the most vital and important for the time in which we live.

The Institutional Dictionary of Astronism,['Cometan'],"The Institutional Dictionary of Astronism is the cumulation of receptions between Cometan and the astronomical world during the Founding era (2013-2021). The publication of this very first full-length Institutional Dictionary of Astronism represents eight years of the development of Astronism from its inception to how it stands today in 2021. The publication of this dictionary also encapsulates Astronism exactly as it exists now and how Cometan conceives it by the end of the Founding era. This dictionary and its contents capture what Astronism is now for posterity to look back on how this astronomical belief system will change as time progresses. Many of the words and definitions of this dictionary will alter as we enter the Establishment era and Astronism continues its progression in becoming world religion. However, what will not ever change is Cometan’s absolute devotion to the stars of the night sky and his discovery of their secrets through his receptions, personal inspirations, and his overall relationship with The Great Cosmos. Covering all the major Astronist beliefs, practices, cultural elements, theories, branches of study, and historical events, A Dictionary of Astronism, also known as the Institutional Dictionary of Astronism, is published by the Astronist Institution through its subsidiary, Astral Publishing, to commemorate the end of the era of The Founding of Astronism. The Founding of Astronism began exactly eight years on 1st July 2013 which sparked Cometan's ideations and indrucies and which afforded him the insight, knowledge, and vision to found a new religious movement, philosophy, spirituality and political ideology. As The Founding of Astronism, also simply known as the Founding era, comes to an end, the Astronist Institution wants to acknowledge the fundamental importance of this year period of the history of Astronism and to the wider history of religion, philosophy and spirituality as a whole. The Dictionary of Astronism immortalises that commemorative spirit by providing thousands of definition entries of Astronist terms that have been authorised by Astronist Institution scholars for dissemination worldwide. This dictionary captures the most up-to-date understanding of what Astronism is and how it as a whole and its component parts should be defined.

The Spiritual Reality of Hajj,['Sultan ul Ashiqeen Hazrat Sakhi Sultan Mohammad Najib ur Rehman Madzillah ul Aqdus'],"This Book is the rarest attempt of its kind which brings out the true purpose of performing the basic obligation of Islam called Hajj. It delivers a guidance to any true seeker of Reality and discloses that the spiritual purpose of Hajj is not only to perform the outward rituals with complete submission to Allah but gaining the spiritual experiences of Divine presence and observation. The book opens one’s eyes to the reality that the outward journey of Hajj is resemblant to the inward journey towards Allah and is an emphasis on the fact that the worship of Hajj, when performed with the presence of heart, is a way of attaining the ultimate closeness to Allah in the worldly life. The book clarifies the misunderstood concept of shariah in the modern world that Hajj is limited only to certain rituals and convinces the reader to deliberate that Islam and Mysticism embrace each other. Following the pure form of shariah is beginning of the road which leads to the recognition of Allah.

The Unknown She,['Hilary Hart'],"Is there a mystical consciousness particularly natural to women? And if so, what role is it playing in the spiritual evolution of our world? To answer these questions, Hilary Hart traveled across the world meeting with contemporary mystics from a variety of traditions including Lakota Sioux, Sufism, Buddhism, and West-African shamanism. The revelations of feminine wisdom offered from these encounters are not conceptual teachings, but vivid examples of lived spirituality expressed sometimes through simple ways of being, sometimes through profound mystical experiences. Revolutionary and remarkably practical, The Unknown She offers a startling new look at women’s unique mystical orientation and its place in the evolution of our universal consciousness. “... for serious students of mystical traditions and women's spirituality, this challenging book offers rewards not found in more conventional works.” —Publishers Weekly “... a profound exploration of what may become the most important development in the 21st Century: the return of the feminine voice in spiritual experience.” —Tsultrim Allione, author, Women of Wisdom A wonderful book!

The Minoan Epiphany - A Bronze Age Visionary Culture,['Bruce Rimell'],"The art and iconography of the Minoan civilisation of Bronze Age Crete is rightly described as having a refreshing vitality with a fortunate combination of stylisation and spontaneity in which the artist is able to transform conventional imagery into a personal expression. The dynamism, torsion and naturalism evident in Minoan art stands in stark contrast to the hieratic rigidity of other ancient civilisations, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the iconography of the Minoan Epiphany, a set of mainly glyptic (rings, seals, and seal impression) images which appear to depict religious celebrants experiencing direct and seemingly ecstatic encounters with deities. This collection of essays explores this central aspect of Minoan religion, taking a strongly archaeological focus to allow the artefacts to speak for themselves, and moving from traditional ‘representational’ interpretations into ‘embodied’ perspectives in which the ecstatic capabilities of the human body throw new light on Aegean Bronze Age ritual practices. Such ideas challenge rather passive assumptions modern Western observers hold about the nature of religious feelings and experiences, in particular the depictions of altered states of consciousness in ancient art, and the visionary potential of dance gestures. Speculative asides on the potential for a Minoan origin for Classical Greek humanism, and hints in the imagery on ancient Cretan conceptions of the cosmos, are set against sound archaeological theories to explain this lively and dynamic corpus of images. Beautifully illustrated with images and sketches of the relevant artefacts, this wide-ranging volume will stimulate audiences with archaeological, prehistorical and spiritual interests, as well as historians of religion and art. ‘The Minoan Epiphany’ also represents an influential antecendent to the Visionary Humanist philosophy which forms the majority of Bruce’s current independent research interests.",296.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p6wREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=p6wREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=95&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Teaching Children,['Ann El-Moslimany'],"The author explores education from the essential principles of Tawhid (Oneness of God, humanity, knowledge); fitrah (concept of human nature); and the role of humans as vicegerents of God on earth (responsibility and stewardship). The current education system dates back a hundred years or more, and is in desperate need of a 'reboot'. In developing the industrialized society, the education system itself became like a factory, the end product being pupils who merely regurgitate facts, and themselves end up as cogs in the machine that is the wider industrial complex. The legacy of this is a soulless ‘functional’ educational system that fails to develop pupils to meet the present and future needs of individuals and their expectations. This failure inevitably impacts on society and humanity at large. Society has long since moved beyond the industrial revolution and into an age of global connectedness where the sum of human knowledge is freely available via the internet. It is an age where people are generally more well informed and on a variety of issues. An effective holistic educational philosophy is required, one that gives full spiritual meaning to all that a child learns. It should equip children with spiritual awareness, morals and values, social responsibility and accountability, self-discipline and self-determination, self-confidence and empowerment, ambition and aspiration tempered with thoughtfulness and a sense of gratitude.",137.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aFpZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aFpZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=104&source=gbs_api,"A Moral, Spiritual, and Holistic Approach to Educational Development",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aFpZDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-aFpZDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Forbidden Religion,['Jose M. Herrou Aragon'],"Gnosis means knowledge. But we are not referring to just any knowledge. Gnosis is knowledge which produces a great transformation in those who receive it. Knowledge capable of nothing less than waking up man and helping him to escape from the prison in which he finds himself. That is why Gnosis has been so persecuted throughout the course of history, because it is knowledge considered dangerous for the religious and political authorities who govern mankind from the shadows. Every time this religion, absolutely different from the rest, appears before man, the other religions unite to try to destroy or hide it again. Primordial Gnosis is the original Gnosis, true Gnosis, eternal Gnosis, Gnostic knowledge in its pure form. Due to multiple persecutions, Primordial Gnosis has been fragmented, distorted and hidden.",,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NonyAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NonyAwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=111&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NonyAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NonyAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

E. M. Forster's Spiritual Journey in His Life and Works,['Jeane Noordhoff Olson'],"From the Author’s Preface: Birthdays are often the occasion for assessing earlier experiences and expressing hopes for the future. Opening the pages on a new century can stimulate a similar reckoning of accounts on a larger scale. January first of the year 1900 was both the beginning of a new century, as popular counting goes, and Edward Morgan Forster’s twenty-first birthday. As the Victorian era approached its conclusion, Forster was nearing the end of his studies at King’s College, Cambridge University. His great-aunt Marianne Thornton had left him the legacy that saw him through the university. But how would he support himself thereafter? The future was unclear until Nathaniel Wedd, a tutor who had become a good friend, encouraged him to seriously consider writing as a lifetime occupation. Forster eagerly grasped the idea. His first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread, was published to popular approval before he was thirty years old. Forster’s first four novels, Where Angels Fear to Tread, The Longest Journey, A Room with a View, and Howards End, were all written within six years, between 1905 and 1910, with A Passage to India being published in 1924 and his homosexual novel, Maurice,seeing the light of day only after his death. All these novels were widely acclaimed when first published and are still in print. Forster had a mind full of projects on which he lavished his energy and prescient thoughts. His homosexuality was an ever-present black cloud affecting his actions and fears. The reader who wants a deeper treatment of that significant aspect of his life should read Wendy Moffat’s masterly—and graceful—volume, A Great Unrecorded History. Partly a biography of Forster, it is also a study of the era in which a conviction of homosexuality meant two years in prison doing hard labor. Homosexuality was also a challenge he had to confront every day. Another constant subject was freedom of speech and the threat of censorship, often in the name of national security.

Ramakatha Rasavahini Volume 2,['Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba'],"This edition of Ramakatha Rasavahini improves on the previous edition. Grammatical errors and typos have been corrected, and some sentences have been rewritten to smooth and clarify the presentation —of course, without disturbing the meaning. Long paragraphs have been split in two to provide easier reading. Sanskrit words have been replaced by English equivalents, to make the text accessible to readers who do not know Sanskrit. The accuracy of the text has been maintained by putting Sanskrit words in parentheses, after their English translations. Several Sanskrit words have made their way into the English language and can be found in most dictionaries —e.g. dharma, guru, yoga, and moksha. These words are mostly used without translation, although their meanings appear in the glossary at the end of the book. Besides definition of Sanskrit words used in this book, the glossary contains descriptions of the people and places mentioned. This edition is being brought out in ebook form, for tablets such as the Kindle, Ipad, and Nook. Clicking on most Sanskrit words, people, and places will take you right to the glossary, where you can find the meaning. A back-button will be available in your reader to take you back to where you were reading. And on these tablets, you generally get to choose a font and font size that suits you. With these changes, we hope that the revised Ramakatha Rasavahini will be of great benefit to earnest seekers in the spiritual realm.

Cultural China 2020,"['Séagh Kehoe', 'Gerda Wielander']","Cultural China is a unique annual publication for up-to-date, informed, and accessible commentary about Chinese and Sinophone languages, cultural practices, politics and production, and their critical analysis. It builds on the University of Westminster’s Contemporary China Centre Blog, providing additional reflective introductory pieces to contextualise each of the eight chapters. The articles in this Review speak to the turbulent year that was 2020 as it unfolded across cultural China. Thematically, they range from celebrity culture, fashion and beauty, to religion and spirituality, via language politics, heritage, and music. Pieces on representations of China in Britain and the Westminster Chinese Visual Arts Project reflect our particular location and home. Many of the articles in this book focus on the People’s Republic of China, but they also draw attention to the multiple Chinese and Sinophone cultural practices that exist within, across, and beyond national borders. The Review is distinctive in its cultural studies-based approach and contributes a much-needed critical perspective from the Humanities to the study of cultural China. It aims to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and debate about the social, cultural, political, and historical dynamics that inform life in cultural China today, offering academics, activists, practitioners, and politicians a key reference with which to situate current events in and relating to cultural China in a wider context.",182.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w95UEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w95UEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=197&source=gbs_api,The Contemporary China Centre Review,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w95UEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-w95UEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Astronomy in the Origins of Religion,['Cometan'],"Official title: Do the prehistoric interactions between astronomy and religion form a distinct religious tradition? In the dissertation for his Master's of Arts degree from the University of Central Lancashire, Cometan introduced and thoroughly explored his theory of the existence of the oldest religious tradition based on astronomical observation which he titles the Astronic tradition, or Astronicism. In this work, which received a Distinction Grade of 87 following its examination, Cometan discovers that astronomy and religion were indeed intertwined in prehistoric and ancient times. Through archaeological evidence, Cometan makes the case for the existence of an Astronic religious tradition stretching back to the Upper Palaeolithic period of the Stone Age some 40,000 years ago. Key ideas of Cometan's dissertation work include astromorphism, astrolatry, astroglyphs, astromancy, astronomical religion, and the theory of an astronomical Urreligion (an original or primordial religion).",96.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Q_9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_Q_9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=220&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Q_9DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_Q_9DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Organized Secularism in the United States,"['Ryan T. Cragun', 'Christel Manning', 'Lori L. Fazzino']","There has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of the US population that is not religious.

This is a book about the rise and structure of organized secularism in the United States. By organized secularism we mean the efforts of nonreligious individuals to build institutions, networks, and ultimately a movement that serves their interests in a predominantly religious society. Researchers from various fields address questions such as: What secularist organizations exist? Who are the members of these organizations? What kinds of organizations do they create? What functions do these organizations provide for their members? How do the secularist organizations of today compare to those of the past? And what is their likely impact on the future of secularism?

The Depth to Delve... Deep,['Rote Writer'],"He slips through the hedgeow and in no time is seen sitting on the bench surprised by it all. In the shadow of Old Sarum he sits. Salisbury is in sight. It slopes slowly from the old to the new. Now hungry and not too sure what to do about the rue he concludes… ‘I can live with the hunger for a bit… but the thirst I can’t.’ He finds a thrown water bottle and heads into town down a road sloping into Salisbury. Just short of the town, he passes by a park and spots a fountain. He doesn’t think he just drinks, with thirsty urgency. He rinses then fills up his bottle. Rote returns to his hideaway without even venturing into the town proper. He’s pickled by the predicament. He’s embarrassed. His pride is really riding him. He’s unable to make eye contact with people passing by. Back at the bench he crawls back into the bushes when no one's looking. He pulls out his orange plastic bag and his basically brand new sleeping bag that after last night looks old. It’s not even midday yet. He doesn’t want anyone to see him. He has no money. He has no food. He has water. He has a briar bush for a home. It’s wet and always leaking. It’s infested with all sorts of crawling things. And there’s garbage strewn here and there. Some of it is blown in and then torn by dogs. He’s fraught with the facts—he’s fucked. That afternoon and night he stays burrowed in his bane going insane, wrestling with his dilemma. He’s haunted and daunted by his hunger. He tries to ignore his starving stomach. He tries to hide his pride. The following morning he awakes slobbered with saliva, washed with froth from another friendly face, truly a restoring grace. Those dogs delight him in their exuberance upon discovering a bushwhacked bum. Aye, a found friend, wagging him well with a non-judgmental manner. It means a whole lot. They in their way, help to raise Rote’s spirits by letting him know it’s okay and to keep his chin up. Upon packing his pack with his makeshift shack, he burrows them back away and begins his day. Out from behind his bespoken bench he crosses the park. Onto the road he strolls, stirring up a sense of purpose to feed his belly and starve his pride. His pride is like a life preserver; it will buoy him back on track. He passes through the subterranean pedestrian passage under the roundabout of traffic alongside the Avon River. He continues along the road now into Salisbury proper. Only to be stopped by his propped pride, a pill still too ill to swallow. He returns to wallow. Back in his burrow with a deep furrow, he struggles with it all. Oh his pride. And as the day turns into night he struggles some more. Unable to sleep, racked with rancour for the heel he has to hallow. As the sun rises so his spirits, and by the lavish licking, he surrenders too. It brings a smile to his face. Hunger soon supersedes all qualms with his pride. He proceeds to Salisbury proper. He’s struggled enough and to no end, with the thought and the need thereof of begging. And boy is it a proud pill to swallow. It’s in his best interest. At that point, he doesn’t see any other way of collecting coins to curb his hunger pangs and his tobacco withdrawals... great motivating factors for sure. He’s desperate. He’s defiantly delayed any render to surrender that in turn will chide his pride. He tries to fend the facts, but faced with them there really is no other possible play. He’s forced to say, “Excuse me… but can you spare some change.” A truly inspired story steeped in history that starts with Rote sending his manuscript overseas to London England.",484.0,['Travel'],4.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KkINVMksW2IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KkINVMksW2IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=279&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KkINVMksW2IC&rdid=book-KkINVMksW2IC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
North-South Co-operation,['Caroline Sweetman'],"This book in the Focus on Gender series looks at co-operation for development: between North, South, and East; women's organisations and funding agencies; development practitioners, academics, and civil society; politicians and economists; and women and men. Currently, the world is in economic and political crisis, of which escalating conflict is a symptom. In this book, writers from South and North stress that such crisis can only be resolved if we recognise that we are all involved in a global system which perpetuates poverty and inequality, not only in the South and East, but also in the North. Organisations which seek to relieve poverty must find ways to listen to, value, and learn from Southern experience of development. Linking initiatives are one way of enabling people of different cultures and backgrounds to share experience, build mutual respect, and reach common ground, while acknowledging the value of difference. It is essential for Northern funding agencies to foster multiculturalism and gender equity within their own structures, as well as in their work with Southern counterparts. Topics covered include: making the global links between women and poverty; listening to the South; linking for solidarity; women's participation and international fora; the true meaning of partnership; and the 'feminisation' of organisational culture.

"Refugee, Migrant and Ethnic Minority Health","['Osnat Keidar', ' Emmanouil Pikoulis', 'Aristomenis Exadaktylos', 'David Shiva Srivastava']","International migration, particularly to Europe, has increased in the last few decades, making research on aspects of this phenomenon, including numbers, challenges, and successes, particularly vital. This Special Issue highlights this necessary and relevant area of research. It presents 37 articles including studies on diverse topics relating to the health of refugees and migrants. Most articles (28) present studies focusing on European host countries. The focus on Europe is justified if we take into consideration the increased number of refugees and migrants who have come to Europe in recent years. However, there are also articles which present studies from countries in other continents. The topics discussed in the Issue include healthcare utilization, infectious diseases, mother and child health, mental health, and chronic diseases. Finding from the included articles indicate that further development of guidelines and policies at both local and international levels is needed. Priorities must be set by encouraging and funding in-depth research that aims to evaluate the impact of existing policies and interventions.

I was born Mother of Saint,['Laerte do Cachoeira'],"This is the English version of the original in Portuguese (2017): “Nasci Mãe de Santo - A maravilhosa história da Yalorixá Mãe Senhora de Umbanda, Sacerdotisa de Z A M B Y” (ISBN 978-85-924121-0-4). The book is a tribute to Mãe Senhora de Umbanda, in her extremely rare condition as Yalorixá Priestess of Z A M B Y, Consecrated by the Most High, Daughter of Ogum Quebramar and Yansã Guaracyara, Leaders Orixás of the Tenda de Umbanda Morada dos Orixás. It describes her beautiful trajectory in Umbanda in this reincarnation (1930-2015), preceded that was by her Consecration by the HIGHEST - hence the title “I was born Mother of Saint”, with emphasis on her total adoration to the CREATOR, as the faithful and discreet servant, and her greater mission, given by Our Father OXALÁ - and fulfilled with praise, to carry the Love of Our Lord JESUS to the depths of the Abyss. Preliminarily to this description, covered in Part II of the book, it is made a contextualization in relation to Umbanda, as detailed in Part I, in which is given emphasis to the Meaning, Origin and Organization of UMBANDA, including related themes, such as religious syncretism, evolution of spirits, Umbral and Quimbanda. The gestation of the book dates back to the 1980s, when the author, Laerte do Cachoeira, was honored by Yansã Guaracyara with the mission of one day writing it, as Yobá of Yansã ('The Eyes of Yansã'). Throughout this period, records were made of guidelines and revelations made by the Orixás and the People of Exu when incorporated in Mãe Senhora de Umbanda during the giras (sessions) in the Terreiro, as well as testimonies made by Mãe Senhora, in addition to recordings in audios and videos, which were compiled and organized after her passage. The records that were selected and included in the book are duly referenced, either in the body of the text or in footnotes. Everything else in the book, although it expresses the author's own thought, it is his conviction that mirrors all guidance and help received from the Orixás and the Exu People, under the command of Ogum Quebramar and Yansã Guaracyara, for the elaboration of this tribute from the Tenda de Umbanda Morada dos Orixás to its Beloved Yalorixá. It is important to note that, in line with the Statutes of the Tenda de Umbanda Morada dos Orixás, this book will not be sold, either in part or in whole. To this end, the book, including all attachments, with photos, audios and videos, is being freely available on the internet (for unrestricted public access) at https://msumbanda.blogspot.com.br/ .

Basal Concepts in Philosophy,['Alexander Thomas Ormond'],"""The motive of this volume is a desire to restore the primacy of certain conceptions which are in danger of disappearing from our modern thinking, and to reform others which, as I think, have been wrongly or inadequately conceived. Reflection has led me to dissent from monistic pantheism on the one hand, and from agnosticism on the other, two of the leading tendencies in the thought of our century, and to seek a metaphysical basis for philosophy that may adequately ground a rational theory of knowledge and being. With this end in view, I have sought to reconstruct philosophy upon the trinal categories of being, non-being, and becoming, and also to reform the current methods of metaphysics by showing that a completely rational idea of being can be achieved only when we represent it under our highest and most concrete categories and translate it into self-conscious personal spirit. The result is a spiritualistic metaphysic which leads us to ground the world of reality in an Absolute possessed of supreme intelligence, goodness, and love. The order in which the basal concepts emerged in my own thinking, is substantially as follows: Having, by historic study and reflection, become convinced of the identity of the logos with the principle of conscious personality, I began to see its value as a means of penetrating the opaque absolute of the agnostic creed, and obtaining an intelligible conception of its inner nature and connection with the relative. The application of the logos-category led directly to the personal construction of being and to the idea of the Absolute as personal, self-conscious spirit. It was at this point that the dualistic light came to me in an intuition of the immanent movement or dialectic of spirit. For it became clear that the activity of a self-conscious spirit must be first of all intellectual, and that its primal intellection would be dual in its nature, including a positive intuition of being's self or the logos, and a negative intuition of its not-self or the a-logos. And reflection made it clear also that the logos and a-logos are primal and mutually exclusive opposites, and that while spiritual being is to be conceived as exercising internally the activity which intuites the positive and negative terms, yet the object of the negative intuition, the a-logos, must be excluded from being as its opposite; that is, as non-being. The exclusion of non-being from being as its opposite, never to be identified with it, laid the foundations of a dualistic creed, and through it of a reform of spiritual dialectic in the direction of a non-pantheistic theory of creation and the connection of the Absolute with the sphere of relativity. For it became clear that the primal intuition of non-being would motive an outgo of volitional energy into the negative sphere for its suppression and annulment and that the nature generated out of it would not be pure being but becoming, a creature including in its constitution opposite moments of being and non-being. Thus, through the conception of the negative datum, I began to see that an answer might be forthcoming to the hitherto unresolved problem, why the creative energy of the Absolute falls short of an absolute result and only produces the finite and imperfect. The book itself must answer the question how far the solution is to be regarded as satisfactory""--Preface.

Shrines and Pilgrimage in the Modern World,['Peter Jan Margry'],"The modern pilgrimage—to sites ranging from Graceland to the veterans’ annual ride to to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to Jim Morrison’s Paris grave—is intertwined with man’s existential uncertainties in the face of a rapidly changing world. In a climate that reproduces the religious quest in seemingly secular places, it’s no longer clear exactly what the term pilgrimage infers—and Shrines and Pilgrimage in the Modern World critiques our notions of the secular and the sacred, while commenting on the modern media’s multiplication of images that renders the modern pilgrimage a quest without an object. Using new ethnographical and theoretical approaches, this volume offers a surprising new vision on the non-secularity of the “secular” pilgrimage.

"Rabbi Nachman of Breslov; Who He Was, and What He Said","['Rabbi Nachman of Breslov o.b.m.', 'Rabbi Nussun of Breslov o.b.m.', 'Rabbi Nathan Sternhartz ']","HH: Rabbi Nachman of Breslov lived over 200 years ago. His great grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov had already brought radical reform and revitalization to the world and Judaism, but Rabbi Nachman did not suffice with this spiritual inheritance, rather he sought out anew the very core fundamental essence and source of existence with the Holy Merciful One G-d. Countless times, every single day, he would start completely new, throwing his complete devotion in seeking true life and bonding with the Creator. Although he was blessed with extraordinary brilliance and genius, he shunned sophistication and even put erudition second to prayer. He championed simple devotions, he prized heartfelt prayer and conversation with G-d more than everything. Rabbi Nachman confronted all the vices which influence people, and he conquered and prevailed. He rose above all the trappings and pettiness of human nature, and continued to rise in supernal spiritual attainments of goodness and G-dliness. From his lofty perspective Rabbi Nachman looks into the deepest abyss, and gives firm directions to self redemption. Back in his times the world still had a great deal of denial of human weakness, and open honest admittance to one's failings were almost not existent, just on a very private and somewhat theoretical paradigm. Rabbi Nachman's simple true approach of dedication to addressing one's character and standing in regular sessions of hisbodidus (seclusion) with G-d was a sharp and brutal attack on the sophisticated yet superficial systems which ruled society. Those who strongly needed to find the truth, would find Rabbi Nachman. Slowly his chasidus (sect) of Breslov grew, with individuals who had the strength to stand up for their values even in the face of condemnation by society at large. Ultimately the holy ways of Rabbi Nachman began to inoculate even the views of the world at large, and today we are witness to how the world at large has embraced many of the approaches which had previously been somewhat exclusive to Breslov. Hopefully this little booklet will help that initiative along, there's still quite a way to go B”H. In this little booklet I present many succinct teachings which are basics of Breslov; short, sweet, and to the point. Great care was given to accurately translate the teachings, and their exact sources are provided. In addition there is a short synopsis of who Rabbi Nachman was and what he was about. The booklet also explains the progression of Breslov into the present day, specifically with the revelation of the New Song in a letter signed by Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman. This booklet also has a transliteration of the Teekoon Haklalli – the comprehensive “General” rectification – which are the ten Psalms that Rabbi Nachman prescribed, and a short prayer which has become conventional. In short, this booklet is like a first aid kit, providing some basic directives to help a person gain his/her footing and gather his wit, so that he can get his life in order and set in the right direction. Everyone should be extremely familiar with all the teachings presented, and one should pray profusely and copiously over every teaching to merit to realize and achieve them.",52.0,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",5.0,12.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eS9mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eS9mDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=453&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eS9mDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-eS9mDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

El Retorno de la Feminidad Sagrada y el Alma del Mundo,['Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee'],"Lo femenino contiene el misterio de la creación. Esta verdad simple y primordial a menudo pasa desapercibida. Sin embargo, en estos tiempos de crisis global, que a su vez portan las semillas de una transformación global, es necesario que redespertemos al poder espiritual y al potencial de lo femenino. Las cualidades femeninas forman parte tanto del hombre como de la mujer y nos empujan hacia las profundidades de nuestro ser, hasta los misterios del alma, cuya sabiduría se denomina Sofía. Sin lo femenino nada nuevo puede nacer, nada nuevo puede llegar a la existencia; quedaríamos atrapados en las imágenes materialistas de la vida que están contaminando nuestro planeta y profanando nuestras almas. Tenemos que volver al centro de nuestro ser, al lugar donde lo sagrado se manifiesta en la existencia. Y la feminidad mística contiene la clave para poder llevar a cabo esta labor de redención y de transformación. En las últimas dos décadas Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee ha impartido enseñanzas sobre lo femenino y el anima mundi, el Alma del Mundo, que por primera vez han sido recopiladas en este libro.",266.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RcqKCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RcqKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=461&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Measuring Well-being,"['Matthew T. Lee', 'Laura D. Kubzansky', 'Tyler J. VanderWeele']","""This edited volume explores conceptual and practical challenges in measuring well-being. Given the bewildering array of measures available, and ambiguity regarding when and how to measure particular aspects of well-being, knowledge in the field can be difficult to reconcile. Representing numerous disciplines including psychology, economics, sociology, statistics, public health, theology, and philosophy, contributors consider the philosophical and theological traditions on happiness, well-being and the good life, as well as recent empirical research on well-being and its measurement. Leveraging insights across diverse disciplines, they explore how research can help make sense of the proliferation of different measures and concepts, while also proposing new ideas to advance the field. Some chapters engage with philosophical and theological traditions on happiness, well-being and the good life, some evaluate recent empirical research on well-being and consider how measurement requirements may vary by context and purpose, and others more explicitly integrate methods and synthesize knowledge across disciplines. The final section offers a lively dialogue about a set of recommendations for measuring well-being derived from a consensus of the contributors. Collectively, the chapters provide insight into how scholars might engage beyond disciplinary boundaries and contribute to advances in conceptualizing and measuring well-being. Bringing together work from across often siloed disciplines will provide important insight regarding how people can transcend unhealthy patterns of both individual behavior and social organization in order to pursue the good life and build better societies""--",625.0,['Medical'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v89VEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v89VEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Religion+Spirituality&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=492&source=gbs_api,Interdisciplinary Perspectives from the Social Sciences and the Humanities,No link available

The journey of the mystic is to retrace this circle and so experience the oneness that is hidden within us.

This last named course it was they determined to pursue. Recruiting for armies to serve under foreign governments was forbidden by the terms of the Foreign Enlistment Act; by suspending iti operation for two years they in effect said to the tottering Spanish government--Assist you openly and directly we dare not, such policy might cost us our places; but covertly and indirectly we will help you to an Auxiliary Legion of genuine "" Britishers,"" who will fifht for her majesty the Oneen or his majesty th- Devil, if well paid for fighting. Terms were agreed on, abandance of money promised, some fools with a considerable number of rogues enlisted, and the famouft British Legion formed--to the exceeding great joy of Lord Paimerstone, and disgust of absolutists all the world over. On the poor Legion these people exhausted the vocabulary of vituperation. They were not only disgissfvi with its formation, but the, ""material"" of whciii it was composed. On hearing their piteous lamentations, one might have imagined that ""playing at soldiers"" was a game only "" respectable"" people should be engaged in. That the British Legion was not the most respectable body of heroes is quite true. A noble peer described them as the sweepings of our large towns, against which sweeping description I have not one word to say.

Steradians,['Vijay Fafat'],"Our lives are complex hives of perceptions, actions, reactions and analyses. Each of us feels the heat of an unrelenting, watching world judging us at every moment, ascribing motives and character to us which we seek to either enhance or dispute. That is a very powerful social guiding force arising from an imagined, invisible sphere of mental stimulus and impinging on our senses; it is the source of much of our chagrin, dismay and elation. We are creatures desirous of validation and approval as much as we are of habit. These influences cast looming shadows on the core of our being. They are the solid angles which shape and sculpt our character. They are our Steradians. “O how the world stares in a thousand ways of judgment! O how the hurricane hides in that breeze untamed!” Are these shadows mere penumbra of false influences to be shrugged off, or do they carry visceral punches reshaping our character, every passing moment of our days? Following the pattern laid down by “The Ninth Pawn of White - A Book of Unwritten Verses”, the present collection ranges over the same structure of poetic thoughts - singlets, couplets, quatrains - all designed to evoke a participative experience in the reader. In isolation, they are hesitant thoughts, uncertain of their own meaning and pith. All they request is the reader’s immersion in their figurative pond, making the author's craft invisible. They wish not to convey an experience of cleverness or a flash of emotion at an arm's length; their fulfillment lies in their connection with what the reader’s pen seeks to write.

Quiescence,['Vijay Fafat'],"An Engineered Banker with poetic fancies at heart"" is how Vijay Fafat describes himself in self-effacing moments. Born and brought up in Mumbai when it was still ""Bombay,"" Vijay spent half his life in the US before migrating to Singapore. Vijay has published 3 books featuring ultra-short short English verses: - The Ninth Pawn of White - A Book of Unwritten Verses - Quiescence- Musings Against A Setting Sun - Steradians - Reflecting the Angular Facets of Life He has also written 2 books on Hindi-Urdu-English verses: - Mrigjal Pe Behti Kashti - Sailing on a Mirage - Mrig-trishna - Unquenched He is currently working on a few different writing projects, still learning the craft of it... - a novel which revolves around the Indian epic, ""Mahabharat,"" - a collection of stories where mathematics, magic realism, mythology, science fiction and metaphysical aspects of the world are central features. - a book of English poems Over the years, he has subconsciously realized that one's profession may provide subsistence, but it is really the moonlighting on your secret passion which sails your spirit. Vijay ardently believes that any form of writing should be immersive, taking the reader on a mind's journey where she feels one with the created word. Whether it is a jolt of Magic Realism story, a set of struggling verses, or even a technical paper, it is the conviction of the writing which is its innate force, its raison d'etre. Vijay enjoys taking leisurely breaks for nature-travel with his family, dragon-boating, reading Borges and Bradbury, indulging in hilarious karaoke sessions, and spreading a lighter mood all around over cups of tea and banter.

Mrigjal Pe Behti Kashti,['Vijay Fafat'],"“Mrigjal” (“Mirage”) is a Hindi-English book which delves into the short Urdu verse form called “Shayari”. While the primary verses - written by the author - are in Hindi / Urdu, the author has provided English transliteration and translation for each verse as well to make the book more widely accessible to the English-speaking readers. Mrigjal invokes the metaphor of life being a ship sailing on the mirage of our fleeting existence, an illusion woven by Maya. It explores the tides which ripple on the false waters of life, buffeting the common man with its quotidian vagaries. The poor man rows his little skiff with all his heart on these choppy, misdirecting waters, convinced that salvation lies on the other side of this non-existent river. Many are the oars he employs to sail forward - love, anger, enthusiasm, friendship, quarrels, petulance, melancholy, nostalgia, hunger, jealousy, spite, greed, desire. Every dusk brings with it a celebration of these oars, a festival of all the vices and virtues. For some, the revelry meditates in the melancholy of inner thoughts; for others, it unfurls with abandon in drunken parties. In all such gatherings, sometimes the sommelier makes us quaff the wine of life, sometimes we turn the bottles on the sommelier. If intoxication is part of their lives, so is the sadness which flows out of the same bottle of grief. Here, then, is that same paper boat, the same goblet of inebriated thoughts carved onto some blank pages.

Advancing Energy Policy,"['Chris Foulds', 'Rosie Robison']","This open access book advocates for the Social Sciences and Humanities to be more involved in energy policymaking. It forms part of the European platform for energy-related Social Sciences and Humanities’ activities, and works on the premise that crossing disciplines is essential. All of its contributions are highly interdisciplinary, with each chapter grounded in at least three different Social Sciences and Humanities disciplines. These varying perspectives come together to cover an array of issues relevant to the energy transition, including: energy poverty, justice, political ecology, governance, behaviours, imaginaries, systems approaches, modelling, as well as the particular challenges faced by interdisciplinary work. As a whole, the book presents new ideas for future energy policy, particularly at the European level. It is a valuable resource for energy researchers interested in interdisciplinary and society-relevant perspectives. Those working outside the Social Sciences and Humanities will find this book an accessible way of learning more about how these subjects can constructively contribute to energy policy.",193.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=461qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=461qDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=4&source=gbs_api,Lessons on the integration of Social Sciences and Humanities,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=461qDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-461qDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Research Assessment in the Humanities,"['Michael Ochsner', 'Sven E. Hug', 'Hans-Dieter Daniel']","This book analyses and discusses the recent developments for assessing research quality in the humanities and related fields in the social sciences. Research assessments in the humanities are highly controversial and the evaluation of humanities research is delicate. While citation-based research performance indicators are widely used in the natural and life sciences, quantitative measures for research performance meet strong opposition in the humanities. This volume combines the presentation of state-of-the-art projects on research assessments in the humanities by humanities scholars themselves with a description of the evaluation of humanities research in practice presented by research funders. Bibliometric issues concerning humanities research complete the exhaustive analysis of humanities research assessment. The selection of authors is well-balanced between humanities scholars, research funders, and researchers on higher education. Hence, the edited volume succeeds in painting a comprehensive picture of research evaluation in the humanities. This book is valuable to university and science policy makers, university administrators, research evaluators, bibliometricians as well as humanities scholars who seek expert knowledge in research evaluation in the humanities.",247.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6NhCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6NhCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=5&source=gbs_api,Towards Criteria and Procedures,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6NhCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6NhCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Understanding Society and Natural Resources,"['Michael J. Manfredo', 'Jerry J. Vaske', 'Andreas Rechkemmer', 'Esther A.

This book explores the growing concern of how best to achieve effective integration of the social science disciplines as a means for furthering natural resource social science and environmental problem solving. The chapters provide an overview of the history, vision, advances, examples and methods that could lead to integration. The quest for integration among the social sciences is not new. Some argue that the social sciences have lagged in their advancements and contributions to society due to their inability to address integration related issues. Integration merits debate for a number of reasons. First, natural resource issues are complex and are affected by multiple proximate driving social factors. Single disciplinary studies focused at one level are unlikely to provide explanations that represent this complexity and are limited in their ability to inform policy recommendations. Complex problems are best explored across disciplines that examine social-ecological phenomenon from different scales. Second, multi-disciplinary initiatives such as those with physical and biological scientists are necessary to understand the scope of the social sciences. Too frequently there is a belief that one social scientist on a multi-disciplinary team provides adequate social science representation.

Changing Roles of Library Professionals,Unknown,"""Over the past ten years, many changes have affected the roles of librarians and other professionals in research libraries. The changes have been caused, in part, by technological advances, reorganizations, more focus on libraries as learning organizations, the use of teams and team-based approaches to tasks, and a recognition of diversity's importance to organizational development. Librarians have had to align priorities with redefined institutional goals. The survey for this SPEC Kit was an effort to examine these professional changes through an analysis of position descriptions issued by ARL member institutions. What follows are the results of the survey conducted in January 1999 by the ARL Leadership Committee whose membership included: Nancy Baker, Washington State University; Joan Giesecke, University of Nebraska–Lincoln; Carolyn Snyder, Southern Illinois University; DeEtta Jones, ARL Senior Program Officer for Diversity; and Kathryn Deiss, ARL/OLMS Program Manager""--Introduction to the executive summary, page 9.",158.0,['Academic librarians'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m7PgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m7PgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA141&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=118&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m7PgAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-m7PgAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Deleuze and the Passions,"['Ceciel Meiborg (Ed.)', 'Sjoerd van Tuinen']","In recent years the humanities, social sciences and neuroscience have witnessed an 'affective turn, ' especially in discourses around post-Fordist labor, economic and ecological crises, populism and identity politics, mental health, and political struggle. This new awareness would be unthinkable without the pioneering work of Gilles Deleuze, who replaced judgment with affect as the very material movement of thought: every concept is an affective experience, a becoming. Besides entirely active affects, the highest practice of thought, there is no thought without passive affects or passions. Instead of a calm and rational philosophy of passions, Deleuzian thought is therefore inseparable from ""isolated and passionate cries"" that deny what everybody knows and what nobody can deny: ""every true thought is an aggression."" This inseparability of reason and passion is by no means an anti-intellectualist or irrationalist stance. Rather, it is critical, since it protects reason from its self-imposed stupidity (bêtise) by relating it to the unthought forces that condition it. And it is clinical, because thought becomes possessed by a power of selection. The purely active, i.e. free-floating, unrecorded desire, is never enough to produce a consistent relation to the future, which is why we need the passions to give us an initial orientation, to force and enable us to think. Passions are the beliefs, perceptions, representations, and opinions that attach us to the world; they make up the very material of which our lives and thoughts are composed. Instead of truth as the ultimate criterion of judgment, the only principle according to which affective becomings can be selected and evaluated is the extent to which they proliferate joy. Spinoza and Marx show how the recruitment of desire traditionally takes place through the tyrants and priests who inspire sad passions in us. Similarly, the work of Deleuze and Guattari on capitalism and schizophrenia can be read as an encyclopedia of the passions that constitute the affective infrastructure of the socius of contemporary capitalism. If it takes a lot of inventiveness or imagination to be able to diagnose our present becomings, this is because becomings are always composites of joyful and sad passions. Capitalism could not exist if it did not also inspire happiness, love, courage, and perhaps even beatitude. That is why, today, we witness ""the spectacle of the happily dominated"" (Frédéric Lordon) of the self-entrepreneur, the managerial class, the flex worker, the citizen-consumer, the bean-roasting hipster, and the self-managed team. It is within this field of contradictory and heterogeneous passions that the authors of this volume pursue the diagnosis of our past and present becomings.

Situating Sustainability,"['C. Parker Krieg', 'Reetta Toivanen']","Situating Sustainability reframes our understanding of sustainability through an emerging international terrain of concepts and case studies. These approaches include material practices, such as extraction and disaster recovery, and extend into the domains of human rights and education. This volume addresses the need in sustainability science to recognize the deep and diverse cultural histories that define environmental politics. It brings together scholars from cultural studies, anthropology, literature, law, behavioral science, urban studies, design, and development to argue that it is no longer possible to talk about sustainability in general without thinking through the contexts of research and action. These contributors are joined by artists whose public-facing work provides a mobile platform to conduct research at the edges of performance, knowledge production, and socio-ecological infrastructures. Situating Sustainability calls for a truly transdisciplinary research that is guided by the humanities and social sciences in collaboration with local actors informed by histories of place. Designed for students, scholars, and interested readers, the volume introduces the conceptual practices that inform the leading edge of engaged research in sustainability.",366.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x95UEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x95UEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=140&source=gbs_api,A Handbook of Contexts and Concepts,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x95UEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-x95UEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Restless Compendium,"['Felicity Callard', 'Kimberley Staines', 'James Wilkes']","This book is open access under a CC BY license. This interdisciplinary book contains 22 essays and interventions on rest and restlessness, silence and noise, relaxation and work. It draws together approaches from artists, literary scholars, psychologists, activists, historians, geographers and sociologists who challenge assumptions about how rest operates across mind, bodies, and practices. Rest’s presence or absence affects everyone. Nevertheless, defining rest is problematic: both its meaning and what it feels like are affected by many socio-political, economic and cultural factors. The authors open up unexplored corners and experimental pathways into this complex topic, with contributions ranging from investigations of daydreaming and mindwandering, through histories of therapeutic relaxation and laziness, and creative-critical pieces on lullabies and the Sabbath, to experimental methods to measure aircraft noise and track somatic vigilance in urban space. The essays are grouped by scale of enquiry, into mind, body and practice, allowing readers to draw new connections across apparently distinct phenomena. The book will be of interest to students and scholars across a range of disciplines in the social sciences, life sciences, arts and humanities.",205.0,['Sports & Recreation'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uXIzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uXIzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR3&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=148&source=gbs_api,Interdisciplinary Investigations of Rest and Its Opposites,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uXIzDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uXIzDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

The Responsible University,"['Mads Peter Sørensen', 'Lars Geschwind', 'Jouni Kekäle', 'Rómulo Pinheiro']","This book explores how the notion of the responsible university manifests itself at various levels within Nordic higher education. As the impetus of the knowledge society has catapulted the higher education sector to the forefront of policy agendas, universities and other types of higher education institutions face increasing scrutiny, assessment and accountability. This book examines this phenomenon using the Nordic countries as cases in point, given the strong public commitment towards widening participation and public research investments. The editors and contributors analyse the history and current transformations of the idea of the responsible university, investigate new innovations in the educational landscape and look into how universities have begun to organise themselves to become more responsible. Drawing together scholars from the humanities and the social sciences, this interdisciplinary collection will be of interest and value to students and scholars of the role and nature of the modern university, in addition to practitioners and policy makers tasked with finding solutions to address the competing and often contradictory demands posed by a responsibility agenda. .",324.0,['Community and college'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r5nBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5nBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR3&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=152&source=gbs_api,Exploring the Nordic Context and Beyond,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r5nBDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-r5nBDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Approaches to the Medieval Self,"['Stefka G. Eriksen', 'Karen Langsholt Holmqvist', 'Bjørn Bandlien']","The main aim of this book is to discuss various modes of studying and defining the medieval self, based on a wide span of sources from medieval Western Scandinavia, c. 800-1500, such as archeological evidence, architecture and art, documents, literature, and runic inscriptions. The book engages with major theoretical discussions within the humanities and social sciences, such as cultural theory, practice theory, and cognitive theory. The authors investigate how the various approaches to the self influence our own scholarly mindsets and horizons, and how they condition what aspects of the medieval self are 'visible' to us. Utilizing this insight, we aim to propose a more syncretic approach towards the medieval self, not in order to substitute excellent models already in existence, but in order to foreground the flexibility and the complementarity of the current theories, when these are seen in relationship to each other. The self and how it relates to its surrounding world and history is a main concern of humanities and social sciences. Focusing on the theoretical and methodological flexibility when approaching the medieval self has the potential to raise our awareness of our own position and agency in various social spaces today.",347.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5rH8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5rH8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=153&source=gbs_api,"Representations and Conceptualizations of the Self in the Textual and Material Culture of Western Scandinavia, c. 800-1500",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5rH8DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-5rH8DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Building New Bridges - Bâtir de nouveaux ponts,"['Jeff Keshen', 'Sylvie Perrier']","Questions of methodology and the use of sources are fundamental to all academic disciplines. In recent years, this topic has become far more challenging as scholars are increasingly adopting an interdisciplinary approach to achieve richer and deeper analyses, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. Building New Bridges / Bâtir de nouveaux ponts is a collection of scholarly papers that deals with the first principles of source identification and their effective utilization. The contributors to the volume come from a wide range of disciplines and represent both French and English Canada. Together, they explore and encourage the interdisciplinarity trend - around which considerable academic trepidation remains - and seek to explain, for example, how historians and those in English or Lettres françaises analyze texts, how scholars approach paintings, photography, and film, and how the study of music relates tempo and lyrics to wider societal trends.

As historical and contemporary data is rapidly becoming more available, and digital technologies are becoming integral to research in the humanities and social sciences, we sought to bring together contributions that reflect on the different strategies that art market scholars employ to navigate and negotiate digital techniques and resources. The essays in this issue cover a wide range of topics and research questions. Taken together, the essays offer a reflection on what takes to research art markets, which includes addressing difficult topics such as the nature of the research questions and the data available to us, and the conceptual aspects of art markets, in order to define and operationalize variables and to interpret visual and statistical patterns for scholarship. In our view, this discussion is enriched when also taking into account how to use shared or interoperable ontologies and vocabularies to define concepts and relationships that facilitate the use and exchange of linked (open) data for cultural heritage and historical research.",156.0,['Art'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GtvWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GtvWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=164&source=gbs_api,,No link available

History without Chronology,['Stefan Tanaka'],"Although numerous disciplines recognize multiple ways of conceptualizing time, Stefan Tanaka argues that scholars still overwhelmingly operate on chronological and linear Newtonian or classical time that emerged during the Enlightenment. This short, approachable book implores the humanities and humanistic social sciences to actively embrace the richness of different times that are evident in non-modern societies and have become common in several scientific fields throughout the twentieth century. Tanaka first offers a history of chronology by showing how the social structures built on clocks and calendars gained material expression. Tanaka then proposes that we can move away from this chronology by considering how contemporary scientific understandings of time might be adapted to reconceive the present and pasts. This opens up a conversation that allows for the possibility of other ways to know about and re-present pasts. A multiplicity of times will help us broaden the historical horizon by embracing the heterogeneity of our lives and world via rethinking the complex interaction between stability, repetition, and change. This history without chronology also allows for incorporating the affordances of digital media.",195.0,['History'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RDfnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RDfnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=180&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Finding the Limits of the Limes,"['Philip Verhagen', 'Jamie Joyce', 'Mark R. Groenhuijzen']","This open access book demonstrates the application of simulation modelling and network analysis techniques in the field of Roman studies. It summarizes and discusses the results of a 5-year research project carried out by the editors that aimed to apply spatial dynamical modelling to reconstruct and understand the socio-economic development of the Dutch part of the Roman frontier (limes) zone, in particular the agrarian economy and the related development of settlement patterns and transport networks in the area. The project papers are accompanied by invited chapters presenting case studies and reflections from other parts of the Roman Empire focusing on the themes of subsistence economy, demography, transport and mobility, and socio-economic networks in the Roman period. The book shows the added value of state-of-the-art computer modelling techniques and bridges computational and conventional approaches. Topics that will be of particular interest to archaeologists are the question of (forced) surplus production, the demographic and economic effects of the Roman occupation on the local population, and the structuring of transport networks and settlement patterns. For modellers, issues of sensitivity analysis and validation of modelling results are specifically addressed.

Societal Impact of Spaceflight,"['Steven J. Dick', 'Roger D. Launius']","Since the dawn of spaceflight, advocates of a robust space effort have argued that human activity beyond Earth makes a significant difference in everyday life. Assertions abound about the ""impact"" of spaceflight on society and its relationship to the larger contours of human existence. Fifty years after the Space Age began, it is time to examine the effects of spaceflight on society in a historically rigorous way. Has the Space Age indeed had a significant effect on society? If so, what are those influences? What do we mean by an ""impact"" on society? And what parts of society? Conversely, has society had any effect on spaceflight? What would be different had there been no Space Age? The purpose of this volume is to examine these and related questions through scholarly research, making use especially of the tools of the historian and the broader social sciences and humanities.

Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data,['Måns Magnusson'],"Probabilistic topic models have proven to be an extremely versatile class of mixed-membership models for discovering the thematic structure of text collections. There are many possible applications, covering a broad range of areas of study: technology, natural science, social science and the humanities. In this thesis, a new efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm is proposed for Bayesian inference in large topic models. The proposed methods scale well with the corpus size and can be used for other probabilistic topic models and other natural language processing applications. The proposed methods are fast, efficient, scalable, and will converge to the true posterior distribution. In addition, in this thesis a supervised topic model for high-dimensional text classification is also proposed, with emphasis on interpretable document prediction using the horseshoe shrinkage prior in supervised topic models. Finally, we develop a model and inference algorithm that can model agenda and framing of political speeches over time with a priori defined topics. We apply the approach to analyze the evolution of immigration discourse in the Swedish parliament by combining theory from political science and communication science with a probabilistic topic model. Probabilistiska ämnesmodeller (topic models) är en mångsidig klass av modeller för att estimera ämnessammansättningar i större corpusar. Applikationer finns i ett flertal vetenskapsområden som teknik, naturvetenskap, samhällsvetenskap och humaniora. I denna avhandling föreslås nya effektiva och parallella Markov Chain Monte Carlo algoritmer för Bayesianska ämnesmodeller. De föreslagna metoderna skalar väl med storleken på corpuset och kan användas för flera olika ämnesmodeller och liknande modeller inom språkteknologi. De föreslagna metoderna är snabba, effektiva, skalbara och konvergerar till den sanna posteriorfördelningen. Dessutom föreslås en ämnesmodell för högdimensionell textklassificering, med tonvikt på tolkningsbar dokumentklassificering genom att använda en kraftigt regulariserande priorifördelningar. Slutligen utvecklas en ämnesmodell för att analyzera ""agenda"" och ""framing"" för ett förutbestämt ämne. Med denna metod analyserar vi invandringsdiskursen i Sveriges Riksdag över tid, genom att kombinera teori från statsvetenskap, kommunikationsvetenskap och probabilistiska ämnesmodeller.",53.0,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_m9ZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_m9ZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=204&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_m9ZDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_m9ZDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Impact of Migration on Poland,"['Anne White', 'Izabela Grabowska', 'Paweł Kaczmarczyk', 'Krystyna Slany']","How has the international mobility of Polish citizens intertwined with other influences to shape society, culture, politics and economics in contemporary Poland? The Impact of Migration on Poland offers a new approach for understanding how migration affects sending countries, and provides a wide-ranging analysis of how Poland has changed, and continues to change, since EU accession in 2004. The authors explore an array of social trends and their causes before using in-depth interview data to illustrate how migration contributes to those causes. They address fundamental questions about whether and how Polish society is becoming more equal and more cosmopolitan, arguing that for particular segments of society migration does make a difference, and can be seen as both leveller and eye-opener. While the book focuses mainly on stayers in Poland, and their multiple contacts with Poles in other countries, Chapter 9 analyses ‘Polish society abroad’, a more accurate concept than ‘community’ in countries like the UK, and Chapter 10 considers impacts of immigration to Poland. The book is written in a lively and accessible style, and will be important reading for anyone interested in the influence of migration on society, as well as students and scholars researching EU mobility, migration theory and methodology, and issues facing contemporary Europe.",286.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bcFtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bcFtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=207&source=gbs_api,EU Mobility and Social Change,No link available

Family, job, agreements, responsibilities and negotiations are one thing, but, let us say, skydiving, or riding a bike in the company of motorcycle enthusiasts is a different thing—no less an important part of one's life. The current state of affairs is that almost everyone on this planet belongs to some subculture in one way or another. This another, natural part of one's lifestyle for pleasure is not always considered a ""subculture,"" but the heart of the matter does not change because of this. To the point, a person might be a part of more than one subculture, and at the same time know nothing about what it may lead to; they may know nothing about the possible scenarios, goals and intentions of this environment. Even the most attractive and ""mysteriously"" formulated idea (for example, attaining Nirvana) remains something inconceivable, for what is ""Nirvana,"" and how to understand that this state has been achieved is unknown. The idea has no explanations, no criteria and no parameters. And yet, this does not stop people from pursuing ideas as such. Many voluntarily strive for something they know practically nothing about. Why are subcultures so attractive? Why have they become magnets to researchers, professionals and business persons, among all others? These and many other questions require innovative approaches and an unbiased dialogue in an understandable scientific language. The International interdisciplinary conference “Sketch a subculture” united leading experts, scientists, researchers, practitioners, journalists, photographers and thinkers for this discussion on 6 different online panels, where the following questions were discussed: 1. Problems of choosing a research path in studying a subculture. 2. Plan of researching a subculture: from the idea to the completion of the research, from mythological and religious to scientific and philosophical worldviews. 3. From mythologemes to ideas as foundational elements of subculture formation. Approaches for researching mythologemes that underlie the philosophy of a subculture. 4. Approaches for studying the hierarchy of subcultures. Can we claim that the hierarchical structure of all subcultures is identical? 5. Ways to explore the attributes and symbols of subcultures. 6. The phenomenon of “Subculture in Subculture” and characteristics of its study. The synthesis of ideas in the subculture, reasons for the existence of subcultures, invisible internal mechanisms that maintain their continuance. 7. Frederick Lawrence’s drawing as the purpose of subculture research. 8. Can we consider a subculture as a machine that shapes a personality? The idea of death and different ways of implementing this idea by subcultures in daily life. 9. Frederick Lawrence’s drawing, the theory of subculture formation, application of prototype method to understand phenomena. 10. Is it true that one idea forms a whole subculture? The pathway in subculture: fatal and successful. 11. The difference between subculture and religion. What are specific elements that shape each institution? 12.

The Challenge of Chance,"['Klaas Landsman', 'Ellen van Wolde']","This book presents a multidisciplinary perspective on chance, with contributions from distinguished researchers in the areas of biology, cognitive neuroscience, economics, genetics, general history, law, linguistics, logic, mathematical physics, statistics, theology and philosophy. The individual chapters are bound together by a general introduction followed by an opening chapter that surveys 2500 years of linguistic, philosophical, and scientific reflections on chance, coincidence, fortune, randomness, luck and related concepts. A main conclusion that can be drawn is that, even after all this time, we still cannot be sure whether chance is a truly fundamental and irreducible phenomenon, in that certain events are simply uncaused and could have been otherwise, or whether it is always simply a reflection of our ignorance. Other challenges that emerge from this book include a better understanding of the contextuality and perspectival character of chance (including its scale-dependence), and the curious fact that, throughout history (including contemporary science), chance has been used both as an explanation and as a hallmark of the absence of explanation. As such, this book challenges the reader to think about chance in a new way and to come to grips with this endlessly fascinating phenomenon.",276.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nthCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nthCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=222&source=gbs_api,A Multidisciplinary Approach from Science and the Humanities,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nthCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nthCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Bridging Cultural Concepts of Nature,"['Rani-Henrik Andersson', 'Boyd Cothran', 'Saara Kekki']","National parks and other preserved spaces of nature have become iconic symbols of nature protection around the world. However, the worldviews of Indigenous peoples have been marginalized in discourses of nature preservation and conservation. As a result, for generations of Indigenous peoples, these protected spaces of nature have meant dispossession, treaty violations of hunting and fishing rights, and the loss of sacred places. Bridging Cultural Concepts of Nature brings together anthropologists and archaeologists, historians, linguists, policy experts, and communications scholars to discuss differing views and presents a compelling case for the possibility of more productive discussions on the environment, sustainability, and nature protection. Drawing on case studies from Scandinavia to Latin America and from North America to New Zealand, the volume challenges the old paradigm where Indigenous peoples are not included in the conservation and protection of natural areas and instead calls for the incorporation of Indigenous voices into this debate. This original and timely edited collection offers a global perspective on the social, cultural, economic, and environmental challenges facing Indigenous peoples and their governmental and NGO counterparts in the co-management of the planet’s vital and precious preserved spaces of nature.",336.0,['Nature'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4IdZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4IdZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=226&source=gbs_api,Indigenous People and Protected Spaces of Nature,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4IdZEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-4IdZEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Active Materials,"['Peter Fratzl', 'Michael Friedman', 'Karin Krauthausen', 'Wolfgang Schäffner']","What are active materials? This book aims to introduce and redefine conceptions of matter by considering materials as entities that ‘sense’ and respond to their environment. By examining the modeling of, the experiments on, and the construction of these materials, and by developing a theory of their structure, their collective activity, and their functionality, this volume identifies and develops a novel scientific approach to active materials. Moreover, essays on the history and philosophy of metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and materials science provide these various approaches to active materials with a historical and cultural context. The interviews with experts from the natural sciences included in this volume develop new understandings of ‘active matter’ and active materials in relation to a range of research objects and from the perspective of different scientific disciplines, including biology, physics, chemistry, and materials science. These insights are complemented by contributions on the activity of matter and materials from the humanities and the design field.

Slaton', 'Scott Gabriel Knowles', 'Sharon Tsai-hsuan Ku', 'Projit Bihari Mukharji ', 'Rafico Ruiz', 'Tiago Saraiva', 'Karen Senaga', 'Darin Hayton', 'José Torero', 'Patryk Wasiak']","This edited volume gathers eight cases of industrial materials development, broadly conceived, from North America, Europe and Asia over the last 200 years. Whether given utility as building parts, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, or foodstuffs, whether seen by their proponents as human-made or “found in nature,” materials result from the designation of some matter as both knowable and worth knowing about. In following these determinations we learn that the production of physical novelty under industrial, imperial and other cultural conditions has historically accomplished a huge range of social effects, from accruals of status and wealth to demarcations of bodies and geographies. Among other cases, New Materials traces the beneficent self-identity of Quaker asylum planners who devised soundless metal cell locks in the early 19th century, and the inculcation of national pride attending Taiwanese carbon-fiber bicycle parts in the 21st; the racialized labor organizations promoted by California orange breeders in the 1910s, and bureaucratized distributions of blame for deadly high-rise fires a century later. Across eras and global regions New Materials reflects circumstances not made clear when technological innovation is explained solely as a by-product of modernizing impulses or critiqued simply as a craving for profit. Whether establishing the efficacy of nano-scale pharmaceuticals or the tastiness of farmed catfish, proponents of new materials enact complex political ideologies.

Dignity in the 21st Century,"['Doris Schroeder', 'Abol‐Hassan Bani-Sadr']","This book is open access under a CC BY license. This book offers a unique and insightful analysis of Western and Middle Eastern concepts of dignity and illustrates them with examples of everyday life. Dignity in the 21st Century - Middle East and West is unique and insightful for a range of reasons. First, the book is co-authored by scholars from two different cultures (Middle East and West). As a result, the interpretations of dignity covered are broader than those in most Western publications. Second, the ambition of the book is to use examples from everyday life and fiction to debate a range of dignity interpretations supplemented by philosophical and theological theories. Thus, the book is designed to be accessible to a general readership, which is further facilitated because it is published with full open access. Third, the book does not defend one superior theory of dignity, but instead presents six Western approaches and one based on the Koran and then asks whether a common essence can be detected. The answer to the question whether a common essence can be detected between the Koranic interpretation of dignity and the main Western theories (virtue, Kant) is YES. The essence can be seen in dignity as a sense of self-worth, which persons have a duty to develop and respect in themselves and a duty to protect in others. The book ends with two recommendations. First, given the 7 concepts of dignity introduced in the book, meaningful dialogue can only be achieved if conversation partners clarify which variation they are using. Second, future collaborations between philosophers and psychologists might be helpful in moving theoretical knowledge on dignity as a sense of self-worth into practical action. The “scourges” of a sense of self-worth and dignity are identified by psychologists as violence, humiliation, disregard and embarrassment. To know more about how these can be avoided from psychologists, is helpful when protecting a sense of self-worth in others.",101.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VtpCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VtpCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=240&source=gbs_api,Middle East and West,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VtpCDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-VtpCDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
The Digital Humanist,"['Domenico Fiormonte', 'Teresa Numerico', 'Francesca Tomasi']","This book offers a critical introduction to the core technologies underlying the Internet from a humanistic perspective. It provides a cultural critique of computing technologies, by exploring the history of computing and examining issues related to writing, representing, archiving and searching. The book raises awareness of, and calls for, the digital humanities to address the challenges posed by the linguistic and cultural divides in computing, the clash between communication and control, and the biases inherent in networked technologies. A common problem with publications in the Digital Humanities is the dominance of the Anglo-American perspective. While seeking to take a broader view, the book attempts to show how cultural bias can become an obstacle to innovation both in the methodology and practice of the Digital Humanities. Its central point is that no technological instrument is culturally unbiased, and that all too often the geography that underlies technology coincides with the social and economic interests of its producers. The alternative proposed in the book is one of a world in which variation, contamination and decentralization are essential instruments for the production and transmission of digital knowledge. It is thus necessary not only to have spaces where DH scholars can interact (such as international conferences, THATCamps, forums and mailing lists), but also a genuine sharing of technological know-how and experience. ""This is a truly exceptional work on the subject of the digital....Students and scholars new to the field of digital humanities will find in this book a gentle introduction to the field, which I cannot but think would be good and perhaps even inspirational for them....Its history of the development of machines and programs and communities bent on using computers to advance science and research merely sets the stage for an insightful analysis of the role of the digital in the way both scholars and everyday people communicate and conceive of themselves and ""others"" in written forms - from treatises to credit card transactions.""

Social Theory after the Internet,['Ralph Schroeder'],"The internet has fundamentally transformed society in the past 25 years, yet existing theories of mass or interpersonal communication do not work well in understanding a digital world. Nor has this understanding been helped by disciplinary specialization and a continual focus on the latest innovations. Ralph Schroeder takes a longer-term view, synthesizing perspectives and findings from various social science disciplines in four countries: the United States, Sweden, India and China. His comparison highlights, among other observations, that smartphones are in many respects more important than PC-based internet uses. Social Theory after the Internet focuses on everyday uses and effects of the internet, including information seeking and big data, and explains how the internet has gone beyond traditional media in, for example, enabling Donald Trump and Narendra Modi to come to power. Schroeder puts forward a sophisticated theory of the role of the internet, and how both technological and social forces shape its significance. He provides a sweeping and penetrating study, theoretically ambitious and at the same time always empirically grounded.The book will be of great interest to students and scholars of digital media and society, the internet and politics, and the social implications of big data.",210.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zEVLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zEVLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=244&source=gbs_api,"Media, Technology, and Globalization",No link available

It explores a variety of legal issues in the Arctic and Antarctica (i.e., questions of human rights law, environmental law, law of the sea, continental shelf, climate change, energy law, resources, indigenous peoples' rights, etc.,) but also covers the relevant aspects of geopolitics, security, governance, search and rescue, biodiversity, devolution, institutions (e.g., the Arctic Council) and political developments.",304.0,['Conservation of natural resources'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xNjQS5yLpsUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xNjQS5yLpsUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=252&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Decline of the Corporate Community,['Eelke M. Heemskerk'],"Traditionally, much of big business in the industrialized Western world has been organized around particular corporate societies—notoriously referred to as “old boy” networks. With the recent drift toward a more liberal market economy, however, these networks have been showing signs of decline—in some cases, all but disappearing. Eelke M. Heemskerk combines formal network analysis and interviews with key members of the corporate elite in order to examine how this decline has affected Dutch capitalism. Even in a liberal market economy, however, corporate directors need social networks to communicate and coordinate their strategic decisions, and Decline of the Corporate Community considers the shift of the corporate elite to the new private and informal circles where networking takes place.",260.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uygu4_-96mUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uygu4_-96mUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=255&source=gbs_api,Network Dynamics of the Dutch Business Elite,No link available

In the Way of Development,"['Mario Blaser', 'Harvey A. Feit', 'Glenn McRae']","Authored as a result of a remarkable collaboration between indigenous people's own leaders, other social activists and scholars from a wide range of disciplines, this volume explores what is happening today to indigenous peoples as they are enmeshed, almost inevitably, in the remorseless expansion of the modern economy and development, at the behest of the pressures of the market-place and government. It is particularly timely, given the rise in criticism of free market capitalism generally, as well as of development. The volume seeks to capture the complex, power-laden, often contradictory features of indigenous agency and relationships. It shows how peoples do not just resist or react to the pressures of market and state, but also initiate and sustain ""life projects"" of their own which embody local history and incorporate plans to improve their social and economic ways of living.",373.0,['Social Science'],4.0,3.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0UwtqpeBtvQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0UwtqpeBtvQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=274&source=gbs_api,"Indigenous Peoples, Life Projects, and Globalization",No link available
Digital Classics Outside the Echo-Chamber,"['Gabriel Bodard', 'Matteo Romanello']","Edited by organisers of “Digital Classicist” seminars in London and Berlin, this volume explores the impact of computational approaches to the study of antiquity on audiences other than the scholars who conventionally publish it. In addition to colleagues in classics and digital humanities, the eleven chapters herein concern and are addressed to students, heritage professionals and “citizen scientists”. Each chapter is a scholarly contribution, presenting research questions in the classics, digital humanities or, in many cases, both. They are all also examples of work within one of the most important areas of academia today: scholarly research and outputs that engage with collaborators and audiences not only including our colleagues, but also students, academics in different fields including the hard sciences, professionals and the broader public. Collaboration and scholarly interaction, particularly with better-funded and more technically advanced disciplines, is essential to digital humanities and perhaps even more so to digital classics. The international perspectives on these issues are especially valuable in an increasingly connected, institutionally and administratively diverse world. This book addresses the broad range of issues scholars and practitioners face in engaging with students, professionals and the public, in accessible and valuable chapters from authors of many backgrounds and areas of expertise, including language and linguistics, history, archaeology and architecture.

Aging between Participation and Simulation,"['Joschka Haltaufderheide', 'Johanna Hovemann', 'Jochen Vollmann']","With increasing urgency, decisions about the digitalized future of healthcare and implementations of new assistive technologies are becoming focal points of societal and scientific debates and addresses large audiences. Decisions require a careful weighing of risks and benefits and contextualizing in-depth ethical analysis with robust empirical data. However, up to now, research on social assistive technologies is mostly dispersed over different academic fields and disciplines. A comprehensive overview on discussions regarding values at stake and ethical assessment of recent developments especially in healthcare is largely missing. This publication initiates an interdisciplinary discourse on ethical, legal and social implications of socially assistive technologies in healthcare. Contributions include perspectives from nursing science, social sciences, philosophy, medical ethics, economics and law to present an – to our knowledge – first and comprehensive overview on different aspects of the use and implementation of socially assistive technologies from an ethical perspective. It combines practically relevant insights and examples from current research and development with ethical analysis to uncover exemplary moral tipping points between promotion of participation or well-being and risks and damages to these values. Healthcare professionals involved in implementation of smart technologies as well as scholars from the field of humanities, nursing and medicine, interested in the discussions on ethics and technology in healthcare, will benefit from this new contribution. The publication is part of the international DigitAs conference ""Aging between Participation and Simulation – Ethical Dimensions of Socially Assistive Technologies"" held at the Institute of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine (Ruhr University Bochum) from 4 February to 8 February 2019. Within this framework, twelve young scholars were invited to discuss their contributions with renowned experts in the field.

Representation Learning for Natural Language Processing,"['Zhiyuan Liu', 'Yankai Lin', 'Maosong Sun']","This open access book provides an overview of the recent advances in representation learning theory, algorithms and applications for natural language processing (NLP). It is divided into three parts. Part I presents the representation learning techniques for multiple language entries, including words, phrases, sentences and documents. Part II then introduces the representation techniques for those objects that are closely related to NLP, including entity-based world knowledge, sememe-based linguistic knowledge, networks, and cross-modal entries. Lastly, Part III provides open resource tools for representation learning techniques, and discusses the remaining challenges and future research directions. The theories and algorithms of representation learning presented can also benefit other related domains such as machine learning, social network analysis, semantic Web, information retrieval, data mining and computational biology.

The General’s Goose,['Robbie Robertson'],"His admirers said he was a charismatic leader with a dazzling smile, a commoner following an ancient tradition of warrior service on behalf of an indigenous people who feared marginalisation at the hands of ungrateful immigrants. One tourist pleaded with him to stage a coup in her backyard; in private parties around the capital, Suva, infatuated women whispered ‘coup me baby’ in his presence. It was so easy to overlook the enormity of what he had done in planning and implementing Fiji’s first military coup, to be seduced by celebrity, captivated by the excitement of the moment, and plead its inevitability as the final eruption of long-simmering indigenous discontent. A generation would pass before the consequences of the actions of Fiji’s strongman of 1987, Sitiveni Rabuka, would be fully appreciated but, by then, the die had been well and truly cast. The major general did not live happily ever after. No nirvana followed the assertion of indigenous rights. If anything, misadventure became his country’s most enduring contemporary trait.

World of Walls,['Said Saddiki'],"""We’re going to build a wall.” Borders have been drawn since the beginning of time, but in recent years artificial barriers have become increasingly significant to the political conversation across the world. Donald Trump was elected President of the United States while promising to build a wall on the Mexico border, and in Europe, the international movements of migrants and refugees have sparked fierce discussion about whether and how countries should restrict access to their territory by erecting physical barriers. Virtual walls are also built and crushed at increasing speed. In the post-9/11 era there is a greater danger from so-called ""transnational non-state actors”, and computer hacking and cyberterrorism threaten to overwhelm our technological barriers. In this timely and original book, Said Saddiki scrutinises the physical and virtual walls located in four continents, including Israel, India, the southern EU border, Morocco, and the proposed border wall between Mexico and the US. Saddiki’s detailed analysis explores the tensions between the rise of globalisation, which some have argued will lead to a ""borderless world” and ""the end of the nation-state”, and the rapid development in recent decades of border control systems. Saddiki examines both regular and irregular cross-border activities, including the flow of people, goods, ideas, drugs, weapons, capital, and information, and explores the disparities that are reflected by barriers to such activities. He considers the consequences of the construction of physical and virtual walls, including their impact on international relations and the rise of the multi-billion dollar security market. World of Walls: The Structure, Roles and Effectiveness of Separation Barriers is important reading for all those interested in the topics of immigration, border security, international relations, and policy.",152.0,['Political Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yCg5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yCg5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=333&source=gbs_api,"The Structure, Roles and Effectiveness of Separation Barriers ",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yCg5DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yCg5DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Housing Estates in Europe,"['Daniel Baldwin Hess', 'Tiit Tammaru', 'Maarten van Ham']","This open access book explores the formation and socio-spatial trajectories of large housing estates in Europe. Are these estates clustered or scattered? Which social groups originally had access to residential space in housing estates? What is the size, scale and geography of housing estates, their architectural and built environment composition, services and neighbourhood amenities, and metropolitan connectivity? How do housing estates contribute to the urban mosaic of neighborhoods by ethnic and socio-economic status? What types of policies and planning initiatives have been implemented in order to prevent the social downgrading of housing estates? The collection of chapters in this book addresses these questions from a new perspective previously unexplored in scholarly literature. The social aspects of housing estates are thoroughly investigated (including socio-demographic and economic characteristics of current and past inhabitants; ethnicity and segregation patterns; population dynamics; etc.), and the physical composition of housing estates is described in significant detail (including building materials; building form; architectural and landscape design; built environment characteristics; etc.). This book is timely because the recent global economic crisis and Europe’s immigration crisis demand a thorough investigation of the role large housing estates play in poverty and ethnic concentration.

Everyday Revolutions,"['Michelle Arrow', 'Angela Woollacott']","The 1970s was a decade when matters previously considered private and personal became public and political. These shifts not only transformed Australian politics, they engendered far-reaching cultural and social changes. Feminists challenged ‘man-made’ norms and sought to recover lost histories of female achievement and cultural endeavour. They made films, picked up spanners and established printing presses. The notion that ‘the personal was political’ began to transform long-held ideas about masculinity and femininity, both in public and private life. In the spaces between official discourses and everyday experience, many sought to revolutionise the lives of Australian men and women. Everyday Revolutions brings together new research on the cultural and social impact of the feminist and sexual revolutions of the 1970s in Australia. Gay Liberation and Women’s Liberation movements erupted, challenging almost every aspect of Australian life. The pill became widely available and sexuality was both celebrated and flaunted. Campaigns to decriminalise abortion and homosexuality emerged across the country. Activists set up women’s refuges, rape crisis centres and counselling services. Governments responded to new demands for representation and rights, appointing women’s advisors and funding new services. Everyday Revolutions is unique in its focus not on the activist or legislative achievements of the women’s and gay and lesbian movements, but on their cultural and social dimensions. It is a diverse and rich collection of essays that reminds us that women’s and gay liberation were revolutionary movements.",337.0,['Social Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C8m2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=C8m2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=340&source=gbs_api,"Remaking Gender, Sexuality and Culture in 1970s Australia",No link available

"[Given, If, Then]","['Jeremy Fernando', 'Jennifer Hope Davy', 'Julia Hölzl']","Joyous in the exploration of reading's impossibilities and the mystery of being exposed, there, before the unknown. ~Christopher Fynsk, Director of the Centre for Modern Thought, University of Aberdeen and Dean of Media & Communication, European Graduate School[Given, If, Then] attempts to conceive a possibility of reading, through a set of readings: reading being understood as the relation to an Other that occurs prior to any semantic or formal identification, and, therefore, prior to any attempt at assimilating, or appropriating, what is being read to the one who reads. As such, it is an encounter with an indeterminable Other, an Other who is other than other - an unconditional relation, and thus a relation to no fixed object of relation.The first reading by Jeremy Fernando, ""Blind Reading,"" unfolds through an attempt to speak of reading as an event. Untheorisable in itself, it is a positing of reading as reading, through reading, where texts are read as a test site for reading itself. As such, it is a meditation on the finitude and exteriority in literature, philosophy, and knowledge; where blindness is both the condition and limit of reading itself. Folded into, or in between, this (re)reading are a selection of photographs from Jennifer Hope Davy's image archive. They are on the one hand simply a selection of 'impartial pictures' taken, and on the other hand that which allow for something singular and, therefore, always other to dis/appear - crossing that borderless realm between 'some' and 'some-thing.'

"Health of People, Health of Planet and Our Responsibility","['Wael Al-Delaimy', 'Veerabhadran Ramanathan', 'Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo']","This open access book not only describes the challenges of climate disruption, but also presents solutions. The challenges described include air pollution, climate change, extreme weather, and related health impacts that range from heat stress, vector-borne diseases, food and water insecurity and chronic diseases to malnutrition and mental well-being. The influence of humans on climate change has been established through extensive published evidence and reports. However, the connections between climate change, the health of the planet and the impact on human health have not received the same level of attention. Therefore, the global focus on the public health impacts of climate change is a relatively recent area of interest. This focus is timely since scientists have concluded that changes in climate have led to new weather extremes such as floods, storms, heat waves, droughts and fires, in turn leading to more than 600,000 deaths and the displacement of nearly 4 billion people in the last 20 years. Previous work on the health impacts of climate change was limited mostly to epidemiologic approaches and outcomes and focused less on multidisciplinary, multi-faceted collaborations between physical scientists, public health researchers and policy makers. Further, there was little attention paid to faith-based and ethical approaches to the problem. The solutions and actions we explore in this book engage diverse sectors of civil society, faith leadership, and political leadership, all oriented by ethics, advocacy, and policy with a special focus on poor and vulnerable populations. The book highlights areas we think will resonate broadly with the public, faith leaders, researchers and students across disciplines including the humanities, and policy makers.",417.0,['Medical'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T9TkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=T9TkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR3&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=379&source=gbs_api,"Climate Change, Air Pollution and Health",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T9TkDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-T9TkDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Living Earth Community: Multiple Ways of Being and Knowing,"['Sam Mickey', 'Mary Evelyn Tucker', 'John Grim']","Living Earth Community: Multiple Ways of Being and Knowing is a celebration of the diversity of ways in which humans can relate to the world around them, and an invitation to its readers to partake in planetary coexistence. Innovative, informative, and highly accessible, this interdisciplinary anthology of essays brings together scholars, writers and educators across the sciences and humanities, in a collaborative effort to illuminate the different ways of being in the world and the different kinds of knowledge they entail – from the ecological knowledge of Indigenous communities, to the scientific knowledge of a biologist and the embodied knowledge communicated through storytelling. This anthology examines the interplay between Nature and Culture in the setting of our current age of ecological crisis, stressing the importance of addressing these ecological crises occurring around the planet through multiple perspectives. These perspectives are exemplified through diverse case studies – from the political and ethical implications of thinking with forests, to the capacity of storytelling to motivate action, to the worldview of the Indigenous Okanagan community in British Columbia. Living Earth Community: Multiple Ways of Being and Knowing synthesizes insights from across a range of academic fields, and highlights the potential for synergy between disciplinary approaches and inquiries.

The Web as History,"['Niels Brügger', 'Ralph Schroeder']","The World Wide Web has now been in use for more than 20 years. From early browsers to today’s principal source of information, entertainment and much else, the Web is an integral part of our daily lives, to the extent that some people believe ‘if it’s not online, it doesn’t exist.’ While this statement is not entirely true, it is becoming increasingly accurate, and reflects the Web’s role as an indispensable treasure trove. It is curious, therefore, that historians and social scientists have thus far made little use of the Web to investigate historical patterns of culture and society, despite making good use of letters, novels, newspapers, radio and television programmes, and other pre-digital artefacts.This volume argues that now is the time to ask what we have learnt from the Web so far. The 12 chapters explore this topic from a number of interdisciplinary angles – through histories of national web spaces and case studies of different government and media domains – as well as an introduction that provides an overview of this exciting new area of research.",298.0,['Electronic books'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t0ZLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0ZLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=384&source=gbs_api,Using Web Archives to Understand the Past and the Present,No link available

Rembrandt,['Ernst van de Wetering'],"Rembrandts paintings have been admired throughout centuries because of their artistic freedom. But Rembrandt was also a craftsman whose painting technique was rooted the tradition. Rembrandt—The Painter at Work is the result of a lifelong search for Rembrandt's working methods, his intellectual approach to the art of painting and the way in which his studio functioned. Ernst van de Wetering demonstrates how this knowledge can be used to tackle questions about authenticity and other art-historical issues. Approximately 350 illustrations, half of which are reproduced in colour, make this book into a monumental tribute to one of the worlds most important painters.

Contemporary Jewish Reality in Germany and Its Reflection in Film,"['Claudia Simone Dorchain', 'Felice Naomi Wonnenberg']","The notion of “self” and “other” and its representation in artwork and literature is an important theme in current cultural sciences as well as in our everyday life in contemporary Western societies. Moreover, the concept of “self” and “other” and its imaginary dichotomy is gaining more and more political impact in a world of resurfacing ideology-ridden conflicts. The essays deal with Jewish reality in contemporary Germany and its reflection in movies from the special point of view of cultural sciences, political sciences, and religious studies.

Negotiating Climate Change in Crisis,"['Steffen Böhm', 'Sian Sullivan']","Climate change negotiations have failed the world. Despite more than thirty years of high-level, global talks on climate change, we are still seeing carbon emissions rise dramatically. This edited volume, comprising leading and emerging scholars and climate activists from around the world, takes a critical look at what has gone wrong and what is to be done to create more decisive action. Composed of twenty-eight essays—a combination of new and republished texts—the anthology is organised around seven main themes: paradigms; what counts?; extraction; dispatches from a climate change frontline country; governance; finance; and action(s). Through this multifaceted approach, the contributors ask pressing questions about how we conceptualise and respond to the climate crisis, providing both ‘big picture’ perspectives and more focussed case studies.

Searching for Sharing,"['Daniela Merolla', 'Mark Turin']","In a world where new technologies are being developed at a dizzying pace, how can we best approach oral genres that represent heritage? Taking an innovative and interdisciplinary approach, this volume explores the idea of sharing as a model to construct and disseminate the knowledge of literary heritage with the people who are represented by and in it. Expert contributors interweave sociological analysis with an appraisal of the transformative impact of technology on literary and cultural production. Does technology restrict, constraining the experience of an oral performance, or does it afford new openings for different aesthetic experiences? Topics explored include the Mara Cultural Heritage Digital Library, the preservation of Ewe heritage material, new eresources for texts in Manding languages, and the possibilities of technauriture. This timely and necessary collection also examines to what extent digital documents can be and have been institutionalised in archives and museums, how digital heritage can remain free from co-option by hegemonic groups, and the roles that exist for community voices. A valuable contribution to a fast-developing field, this book is required reading for scholars and students in the fields of heritage, anthropology, linguistics, history and the emerging disciplines of multi-media documentation and analysis, as well as those working in the field of literature, folklore, and African studies.

The Archaeology of Europe's Drowned Landscapes,"['Geoff Bailey', 'Hauke Jöns', 'Nena Galanidou', 'Hans Peeters', 'Moritz Mennenga']","This open access volume provides for the first time a comprehensive description and scientific evaluation of underwater archaeological finds referring to human occupation of the continental shelf around the coastlines of Europe and the Mediterranean when sea levels were lower than present. These are the largest body of underwater finds worldwide, amounting to over 2500 find spots, ranging from individual stone tools to underwater villages with unique conditions of preservation. The material reviewed here ranges in date from the Lower Palaeolithic period to the Bronze Age and covers 20 countries bordering all the major marine basins from the Atlantic coasts of Ireland and Norway to the Black Sea, and from the western Baltic to the eastern Mediterranean. The finds from each country are presented in their archaeological context, with information on the history of discovery, conditions of preservation and visibility, their relationship to regional changes in sea-level and coastal geomorphology, and the institutional arrangements for their investigation and protection. Editorial introductions summarise the findings from each of the major marine basins. There is also a final section with extensive discussion of the historical background and the legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the management of the underwater cultural heritage and collaboration between offshore industries, archaeologists and government agencies. The volume is based on the work of COST Action TD0902 SPLASHCOS, a multi-disciplinary and multi-national research network supported by the EU-funded COST organisation (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

The Archaeology of Sulawesi,"[""Sue O'Connor"", 'David Bulbeck', 'Juliet Meyer']","The central Indonesian island of Sulawesi has recently been hitting headlines with respect to its archaeology. It contains some of the oldest directly dated rock art in the world, and some of the oldest evidence for a hominin presence beyond the southeastern limits of the Ice Age Asian continent. In this volume, scholars from Indonesia and Australia come together to present their research findings and views on a broad range of topics. From early periods, these include observations on Ice Age climate, life in caves and open sites, rock art, and the animals that humans exploited and lived alongside. The archaeology presented from later periods covers the rise of the Bugis kingdom, Chinese trade ceramics, and a range of site-based and regional topics from the Neolithic through to the arrival of Islam.

This introduction provides an overview of theory and practice aimed at orienting readers to pertinent literature then previews the chapters that follow. First, though, preliminary definition is in order. Relevant insights are dispersed across literatures on both inter- and trans-disciplinarity, raising the question of how they differ (Klein, 2017). Interdisciplinarity (ID) integrates information, data, methods, tools, concepts, or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of knowledge in order to address a complex question, problem, topic, or theme. Solo interdisciplinarians work independently, but communication across boundaries is essential to collaboration. Transdisciplinarity (TD) transcends disciplinary worldviews by generating overarching synthetic frameworks and, in a connotation that arose in the late 20th century, problem-oriented research that crosses boundaries of academic, public, and private spheres by engaging stakeholders in co-production of knowledge. It also connotes teamwork aimed at generating new conceptual and methodological frameworks. We combine insights from literatures on inter- and trans-disciplinarity in order to acknowledge parallels between the two concepts. Authors of chapters of this volume differ in their conceptualization and use of the terms, as well as the focus of their research. We preserve their original uses of the two terms but synthesize lessons from both literatures in order to arrive at a more robust understanding of the dynamics of communication in teamwork that transcends knowledge boundaries. In the course of our discussion, we also employ nine related concepts defined in the text box: including pidgin and creole, collaborative interdisciplinary reasoning, communicative action, collaborative communication competence, team climate, socio-cognitive platforms for interdisciplinary collaboration, a cooperation and communication culture, mutual and integrative learning, and knowledge convergence.",355.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aS3EDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aS3EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=406&source=gbs_api,,No link available

The result – this volume – offers a 21st-century commentary on the original document, furthering the work of human rights and illuminating the ideal of global citizenship. What does it mean for each of us to be members of a global community? Since 1948, the Declaration has stood as a beacon and a standard for a better world. Yet the work of making its ideals real is far from over. Hideous and systemic human rights abuses continue to be perpetrated at an alarming rate around the world. Too many people, particularly those in power, are hostile to human rights or indifferent to their claims. Meanwhile, our global interdependence deepens. Bringing together world leaders and thinkers in the fields of politics, ethics, and philosophy, the Commission set out to develop a common understanding of the meaning of global citizenship – one that arises from basic human rights and empowers every individual in the world.

The trial in Tokyo was a complex undertaking and international effort to hold individuals accountable for core international crimes and delivering justice. The Tribunal consisted of 11 judges and respective national prosecution teams from 11 countries, and a mixed Japanese–American team of defence lawyers. The IMTFE indicted 28 Japanese defendants, amongst them former prime ministers, cabinet ministers, military leaders, and diplomats, based on a 55-count indictment pertaining to crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The judgment was not unanimous, with one majority judgment, two concurring opinions, and three dissenting opinions. The trial and the outcome were the subject of significant controversy and the Tribunal’s files were subsequently shelved in the archives. While its counterpart in Europe, the ‘International Military Tribunal’ (IMT) at Nuremberg, has been at the centre of public and scholarly interest, the Tokyo Tribunal has more recently gained international scholarly attention. This volume combines perspectives from law, history, and the social sciences to discuss the legal, historical, political and cultural significance of the Tokyo Tribunal. The collection is based on an international conference marking the 70th anniversary of the judgment of the IMTFE, which was held in Nuremberg in 2018.

Beyond Price,['J. David Velleman'],"In nine lively essays, bioethicist J. David Velleman challenges the prevailing consensus about assisted suicide and reproductive technology, articulating an original approach to the ethics of creating and ending human lives. He argues that assistance in dying is appropriate only at the point where talk of suicide is not, and he raises moral objections to anonymous donor conception. In their place, Velleman champions a morality of valuing personhood over happiness in making end-of-life decisions, and respecting the personhood of future children in making decisions about procreation. These controversial views are defended with philosophical rigor while remaining accessible to the general reader. Written over Velleman's 30 years of undergraduate teaching in bioethics, the essays have never before been collected and made available to a non-academic audience. They will open new lines of debate on issues of intense public interest.",232.0,['Philosophy'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ajOrCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ajOrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Humanities+Social+Sciences&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=423&source=gbs_api,Essays on Birth and Death,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ajOrCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ajOrCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Tourists in Our Own Land,['Clifford Adelman'],"This monograph, based on college transcripts of 10,700 students included in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), examines how culturally literate is the generation that is now in its thirties and what people in that generation studied that exposed them to different cultures, societies, and intellectual traditions. Findings determined that the amount of time spent on studying standard college subjects dwarfed the amount of time spent on studying all other cultural information combined. Also, exposure to cultural literacies other than that of western societies was extremely limited, and the bulk of this exposure to western traditions was confined to introductory-level courses. Additionally, the extent to which a student was exposed to cultural information was largely determined by his/her major. Recommendations are provided to students on how to approach, judge, and act upon their academic choices in light of the many requests and requirements from commissions, accreditation bodies, and faculty senates to study certain subjects.

Parenting in Planned Lesbian Families,['Henny Bos'],"Annotation. This thesis reports on a study on lesbian families in which the children were born to the lesbian relationship (planned lesbian families). How strong is the desire of lesbian mothers to have a child, and what are their motivations? How do lesbian mothers experience parenthood? What do they strive for in child rearing? How do they experience the relationship with their partner, and do they feel supported by others? What is the quality of the parent-child relationship in lesbian families? Do lesbian mothers feel rejected, and if so, does this have a negative impact on their role as a parent, and does it negatively influence child adjustment? All these questions are examined in 'Parenting in Planned Lesbian Families', this by studying 100 two-mother families and compare them with 100 heterosexual families. It is the largest study on planned lesbian families to date.

Parenting Education in Indonesia,"['Heather Biggar Tomlinson', 'Syifa Andina']","There is a dynamic and growing energy in Indonesia focusing on parenting education, particularly for low-SES families. However, little is known about parenting styles and related outcomes, much less the coverage and effectiveness of various parenting education approaches. In 2013, the Government of Indonesia commissioned the World Bank to review existing programs and make recommendations to strengthen its parenting education system. This report synthesizes international research while providing detailed information on the seven agencies currently providing parenting education programs in Indonesia, collected from interviews, reports, and data presentations in 2013 and early 2014. Four government ministries and three non-governmental organizations currently offer programming: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Social Affairs, Family Planning Board, Plan, Save the Children, and World Vision. The report notes the commonalities in current program structures and approaches, then articulates recommendations to create a more cohesive and effective system with adequate coverage. In terms of content, authors recommend that providers choose a narrow and meaningful set of messages for respective programs, and enhance content for particularly vulnerable families, such as those with children with disabilities or dealing with chronic illness, natural disaster, conflict, and so forth. To strengthen program design and delivery, eight recommendations emerge, such as articulating measurable goals, ensuring active learning, encourage in-session practice, improving training and compensation for facilitators, and increasing the use of technology. The report includes a matrix of short-term (1-2 years) and medium-term (3-5 years) steps to build a coordinated system of parenting education that involves four areas of action: (1) create the framework; (2) develop an enabling environment; (3) conduct the research; and (4) implement and refine programming.

Early Childhood Development in Latin America and the Caribbean,['Norbert Rüdiger Schady'],"""There is considerable evidence that young children in many developing countries suffer from profound deficits in nutrition, health, fine and gross motor skills, cognitive development, and socio-emotional development. Early childhood development (ECD) outcomes are important markers of the welfare of children. In addition, the deleterious effects of poor outcomes in early childhood can be long-lasting, affecting school attainment, employment, wages, criminality, and measures of social integration of adults. This paper considers the theoretical case to be made for investments in early childhood, selectively reviews the literature on the impact of ECD programs in the United States, discusses the evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, and makes suggestions for future research. The focus is on the relation between outcomes in early childhood and measures of household socioeconomic status, child health, and parenting practices, as well as on the impact of specific policies and programs. The knowledge base on early childhood outcomes is still thin in Latin America and the Caribbean. There are therefore very high returns to comparative descriptive analysis in the region, as well as to careful evaluations of the impact of various programs.

Does Money Matter?,"['Norbert Schady', 'Christina Paxson', 'World Bank']","Abstract: The authors examine how a government-run cash transfer program targeted to poor mothers in rural Ecuador influenced the health and development of their children. This program is of particular interest because, unlike other transfer programs that have been implemented recently in Latin America, receipt of the cash transfers was not conditioned on specific parental actions, such as taking children to health clinics or sending them to school. This feature of the program makes it possible to assess whether conditionality is necessary for programs to have beneficial effects on children. The authors use random assignment at the parish level to identify the program's effects. They find that the cash transfer program had positive effects on the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development of children, and the treatment effects were substantially larger for the poorer children than for less poor children. Among the poorest children in the sample, those whose mothers were eligible for transfers had outcomes that were on average more than 20 percent of a standard deviation higher than those for comparable children in the control group. Treatment effects are somewhat larger for girls and for children with more highly-educated mothers. The authors examine three mechanisms-better nutrition, greater use of health care, and better parenting-through which the transfers might influence child development. The program appeared to improve children's nutrition and increased the chance they were treated for helminth infections. But children in the treatment group were not more likely to visit health clinics for growth monitoring, and the mental health and parenting of their mothers did not improve.",53.0,['Child development'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0GaMbnEIS6wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0GaMbnEIS6wC&pg=PP1&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=43&source=gbs_api,,No link available
Early Childhood Education and Development in Poor Villages of Indonesia,"['Amer Hasan', 'Marilou Hyson', 'Mae Chu Chang']","Indonesia has begun to emerge into middle-income status, yet persistent poverty and stark inequalities continue to affect young children’s development. This book tells the story of Indonesia’s efforts to change the trajectory of development for poor children. Many countries have similar aims, but several aspects of what is reported here are especially valuable and perhaps unique. The study offers data on all aspects of health and development in a sample of rural young children, collected with internationally-validated measures, as well as household information, information about parenting practices including feeding patterns, parent questionnaires, and data on the prevalence and distribution of ECED services. The data reported in this book is based on a sample of more than 6,000 Indonesian children living in 310 poor villages, including two age cohorts (aged 1 and 4 years old when data were first collected on their development in 2009). From the start, the project aimed not only to support service provision but also to support the development of national standards, build national and district capacity, and encourage the establishment of a system of ECED quality assurance, efforts that are still in process. Few such analyses have been done with such a large sample and with multiple measures. These design features allow a high level of confidence in the results that are reported. The lessons from this book will help to inform not only this project’s further implementation but ECED initiatives in Indonesia and around the world. Thus, the results presented in this book are of significance for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners within and beyond Indonesia. The experiences and research results discussed here are especially relevant for: • Researchers in early childhood development and program evaluation; • Policymakers within and beyond Indonesia; • Providers of early childhood services; • Professional development providers; and • Advocates for quality early childhood services.",210.0,['Business & Economics'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4T8SAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4T8SAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=44&source=gbs_api,"Strong Foundations, Later Success",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4T8SAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-4T8SAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Nordic fathers only use 10-30 percent of the total leave. State of Nordic Fathers examines why; and identifies possible avenues to increase fathers’ share of childcare and leave. 10 key findings reveal that fathers’ involvement is a key to gender equality and fathers who have taken long leave distinguish themselves in many respects from those who took none.

Transforming Early Childhood in England:,"['Claire Cameron', 'Peter Moss']","Early childhood education and care has been a political priority in England since 1997, when government finally turned its attention to this long-neglected area. Public funding has increased, policy initiatives have proliferated and at each general election political parties aim to outbid each other in their offer to families. Transforming Early Childhood in England: Towards a Democratic Education argues that, despite this attention, the system of early childhood services remains flawed and dysfunctional. National discourse is dominated by the cost and availability of childcare at the expense of holistic education, while a hotchpotch of fragmented provision staffed by a devalued workforce struggles with a culture of targets and measurement. With such deep-rooted problems, early childhood education and care in England is beyond minor improvements.

The Longest Shortcut,['Anil David'],"David was used to taking shortcuts. As a child he was a pathological liar. By the time he was 14, he had started to steal. At age 26, he was convicted of his first crime, taking clients’ funds, and sent to prison. After being released, he was convicted once again for criminal breach of trust and returned to serve his second sentence. Then in his late thirties, he stole close to $800,000 in a bank fraud, landing him in prison once again. There is another side of Anil’s story. He was sexually abused by an uncle when he was 8. He was initiated into sex by a tutor as a teenager. He grew up with an absent father and a mother that was too busy. His life and ambition were based solely on material things. How then did this convict become an icon of resilience at a National Day celebration? What happened to make him a prize-winning social entrepreneur worthy of investment? Why is he trusted to run a call centre in the men and women’s prisons? In The Longest Shortcut, Anil shares not just about this journey of redemption, but also the lessons he has learnt along the way about self-worth, parenting, leadership and hope. “Anil earned the trust of social impact investors and those around him to establish an organisation that has as its mission the giving of meaningful second chances.” — Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development & Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration",15.0,['Biography & Autobiography'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Q8LEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2Q8LEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=100&source=gbs_api,My Road from Crime and Imprisonment to Self-worth,No link available

Childhood in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,['Albrecht Classen'],"Earlier theses on the history of childhood can now be laid to rest and a fundamental paradigm shift initiated, as there is an overwhelming body of evidence to show that in medieval and early modern times too there were close emotional relations between parents and children. The contributors to this volume demonstrate conclusively on the one hand how intensively parents concerned themselves with their children in the pre-modern era, and on the other which social, political and religious conditions shaped these relationships. These studies in emotional history demonstrate how easy it is for a subjective choice of sources, coupled with faulty interpretations – caused mainly by modern prejudices toward the Middle Ages in particular – to lead to the view that in the past children were regarded as small adults. The contributors demonstrate convincingly that intense feelings – admittedly often different in nature – shaped the relationship between adults and children.",451.0,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iUn-toyhXrwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iUn-toyhXrwC&pg=PP1&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=292&source=gbs_api,The Results of a Paradigm Shift in the History of Mentality,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iUn-toyhXrwC&rdid=book-iUn-toyhXrwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
Family Life in Adolescence,"['Patricia Noller', 'Sharon Atkin']","Many parents fear the time when their beautiful happy children will become unmanageable adolescents continually engaging in risky or destructive behaviour. Unfortunately, this view of adolescents is the focus of the media, even though it relates to just a small proportion of young people. As the large amount of research we report shows, most adolescents are responsible young people who care about their families and crave the support of their parents. It is also true, however, as much research indicates, that the quality of the relationship parents have with their adolescents is crucial to the wellbeing of those young people. We discuss the need for parents to set reasonable limits on their adolescents and to expect appropriate behavior. We also show, on the basis of research, that children who have experienced positive, caring relationships with their parents are more likely than other adolescents to behave responsibly. In other words, behavior in adolescence does not ‘come out of nowhere’ but builds on earlier experiences in the family. Because of the large amount of research reported in this volume, we expect that it will be useful to practitioners from a range of professions that are likely to focus on adolescents: social workers, youth leaders, welfare workers, religious leaders, psychologists and psychiatrists and contribute to a better understanding of young people and their development, and the importance of families to that development.",222.0,['Psychology'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H6AoCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=H6AoCQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=296&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H6AoCQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-H6AoCQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api
An Essay on Science and Narcissism,['Bruno Lemaitre'],"Scientists are often seen as meticulous and impartial individuals solely devoted to their study and the search for scientific truth. But a deeper analysis reveals that many of them are highly egocentric and sensitive to their public image and its associated privileges. Egocentrism, elitism, strategic media occupation and self-enhancement strategies are some of the first particularities that strike a newcomer to the academic world. An Essay on Science and Narcissism analyses the influence of narcissism, an important human personality dimension, on science. The central idea is that narcissism is an advantageous trait for succeeding in an academic environment. Scientists with a high ego are better at convincing others of the importance of their research and, as excellent networkers, they are well placed to exploit the different facets of the research system. In his essay, Bruno Lemaitre also discusses the psychological and sociobiological origins of narcissism and investigates the possible connection between narcissism on one hand, and dominance and short-term mating strategy on the other. The recent increase in narcissism in Western society and how this destabilises not only our society but also scientific practice is also discussed. This essay offers an alternative view of science by analysing the narcissistic personality: prevalent among leading scientists, but rarely placed in the spotlight.",281.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=INjiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=INjiDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=299&source=gbs_api,How do high-ego personalities drive research ?,No link available
The Beatification Story of Irene Mary & Derrick Taylor,"['Irene Mary Taylor', 'Cometan', 'Derrick Taylor']","The initial foundations to the notion that Cometan's grandparents, Irene Mary Taylor and Derrick Taylor, should be recognised for their life as laypeople in the Roman Catholic Church first emerged in January 2020 and October 2021 respectively. Irene Mary was well known for her devotion to Catholicism among her family and acquaintances, yet Cometan saw in her icon and life events an opportunity to reinvigorate Catholic fervour in England and abroad. In his own endeavour as a religious figure and philosopher as the founder of Astronism, Cometan had made it clear that his paternal grandmother had played a large role in his religious life from infancy and so Irene Mary's Cause for Beatification was the culmination of this destined religious figureship. The Beatification Story of Irene Mary Taylor holds the responsibility of presenting Irene Mary for the recognition in the Roman Catholic Church in whichever capacity the Church deems suitable. The book explores the major remembered life events of Irene Mary Taylor, relates them to Catholic doctrine, and systematises them to form Irenianism, Irene Mary's eponymous Catholic system of thought.",282.0,['Religion'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gn0lEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gn0lEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Parenting&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=325&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gn0lEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gn0lEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Science and Technology Governance and Ethics,"['Miltos Ladikas', 'Sachin Chaturvedi', 'Yandong Zhao', 'Dirk Stemerding']","This book analyzes the possibilities for effective global governance of science in Europe, India and China. Authors from the three regions join forces to explore how ethical concerns over new technologies can be incorporated into global science and technology policies. The first chapter introduces the topic, offering a global perspective on embedding ethics in science and technology policy. Chapter Two compares the institutionalization of ethical debates in science, technology and innovation policy in three important regions: Europe, India and China. The third chapter explores public perceptions of science and technology in these same three regions. Chapter Four discusses public engagement in the governance of science and technology, and Chapter Five reviews science and technology governance and European values. The sixth chapter describes and analyzes values demonstrated in the constitution of the People’s Republic of China. Chapter Seven describes emerging evidence from India on the uses of science and technology for socio-economic development, and the quest for inclusive growth. In Chapter Eight, the authors propose a comparative framework for studying global ethics in science and technology. The following three chapters offer case studies and analysis of three emerging industries in India, China and Europe: new food technologies, nanotechnology and synthetic biology. Chapter 12 gathers all these threads for a comprehensive discussion on incorporating ethics into science and technology policy. The analysis is undertaken against the backdrop of different value systems and varying levels of public perception of risks and benefits. The book introduces a common analytical framework for the comparative discussion of ethics at the international level.

"Science, Technology, and Warfare","['Monte D. Wright', 'Lawrence J. Paszek']","The nature of warfare has always been largely determined by contemporary technology. Instances of technological change undertaken for the sake of military advantage have also been relatively common in history. The relationships between science and warfare, however, have been much more variable and ambiguous. The papers and discussions of the Symposium investigate selected aspects of the complex relationships between science and technology on the one hand, and warfare on the other, from the Renaissance to the 1960s. In the first session, Professor Hall takes up in turn the possible areas of interaction between science (exterior ballistics, engineering, explosives, mechanics, and metallurgy) and military technology (edge weapons, cannons and mortars, fortification and siege warfare, and small arms) in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. The notion that science is pursued for utilitarian ends, Hall finds, is an unhistorical projection backward from our own age."" He excludes navigation and medicine from consideration, because they were civil as well as military concerns. In spite of the pleading of certain early propagandists of the Empire of Man over Nature,"" and in spite of the elaborate sketches of military engines in Leonardo's notebooks, military technology was largely innocent of scientific method. The developments in fortification required mathematical skills, but nothing more than elementary geometry and arithmetic. Mathematicians studied the ancient problem of the trajectory of projectiles, but their efforts affected neither the design nor the use of guns.

Dangerous Science,['Daniel J. Rozell'],"The public is generally enthusiastic about the latest science and technology, but sometimes research threatens the physical safety or ethical norms of society. When this happens, scientists and engineers can find themselves unprepared in the midst of an intense science policy debate. In the absence of convincing evidence, technological optimists and skeptics struggle to find common values on which to build consensus. The best way to avoid these situations is to sidestep the instigating controversy by using a broad risk-benefit assessment as a risk exploration tool to help scientists and engineers design experiments and technologies that accomplish intended goals while avoiding physical or moral dangers. Dangerous Science explores the intersection of science policy and risk analysis to detail failures in current science policy practices and what can be done to help minimize the negative impacts of science and technology on society.",162.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9iTUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9iTUDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Technology&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=222&source=gbs_api,Science Policy and Risk Analysis for Scientists and Engineers,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9iTUDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9iTUDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

Technological and Social Environments for Interactive Learning,"['Jelena Jovanović', 'Raymond Chiong']","Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) is a very broad and increasingly mature research field. It encompasses a wide variety of research topics, ranging from the study of different pedagogical approaches and teaching/learning strategies and techniques, to the application of advanced technologies in educational settings such as the use of different kinds of mobile devices, sensors and sensor networks to provide the technical foundation for context-aware, ubiquitous learning. The TEL community has also been exploring the use of artificial intelligence tools and techniques for the development of intelligent learning environments capable of adapting to learners’ needs and preferences and providing learners with personalized learning experience. Recognizing the potential of online social networks, social media, and web-based social software tools as learning platforms for online education, the TEL community has devoted significant time and effort into researching how these popular technologies could be combined with appropriate pedagogical approaches to make learning experience more engaging, satisfying, and successful. Among the most important results of these research endeavors are personal learning environments that allow learners to create mash-ups of diverse social software tools based on their own needs and preferences as well as to create and maintain their online learning networks. Undeniably, technological advancement is making education more accessible to an increasing number of people worldwide. To fully exploit the huge benefit the technology is offering, the TEL community is exploring effective approaches for adapting learning resources to address language, generation, and cultural specificities. Aiming to make learning accessible to all, the community has also focused on the development of solutions for learners with special needs. Finally, it should be noted that all the above mentioned research efforts of the TEL community are finding their applications in different learning contexts and domains, including formal education and informal learning, as well as workplace learning in small, medium, and large organizations. Since the scope of TEL research is constantly evolving, the above given overview of the current research efforts does not aim to be exhaustive by any means. Instead, its purpose is to give some insights into the breadth of research topics and challenges that this edited book aims to cover. The book comprises 14 chapters, which are topically organized into several sections. However, this division of chapters into sections is not strictly definitive as each of the chapters itself presents a comprehensive research work that often spans across diverse TEL areas and thus could be categorized into more than one section of the book.",492.0,['Education'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rKMdAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rKMdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Science+Technology&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=303&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Inside the Politics of Technology,['Hans Harbers'],"Though the old saying claims that man is the measure of all things, the authors of Inside the Politics of Technology argue that the distinction implied between autonomous humans and neutral instruments of technology is an illusion. On the contrary, the technologies humans create simultaneously shape humans themselves. By means of case studies of technologies as diverse as video cameras, electric cars, pregnancy tests, and genetic screenings, this volume considers the implications of this ""co-production"" of technology and society for our philosophical and political ideas. Are only humans endowed with social, political, and moral agency, or does our technology share those qualities? And if so, how should we understand—or practice—a politics of technology?",313.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gn0npEsCRYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Gn0npEsCRYYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Technology&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=337&source=gbs_api,Agency and Normativity in the Co-production of Technology and Society,No link available
Science Policy Under Thatcher,['Jon Agar'],"﻿Margaret Thatcher was prime minister from 1979 to 1990, during which time her Conservative administration transformed the political landscape of Britain. Science Policy under Thatcher is the first book to examine systematically the interplay of science and government under her leadership. Thatcher was a working scientist before she became a professional politician, and she maintained a close watch on science matters as prime minister. Scientific knowledge and advice were important to many urgent issues of the 1980s, from late Cold War questions of defence to emerging environmental problems such as acid rain and climate change. Drawing on newly released primary sources, Jon Agar explores how Thatcher worked with and occasionally against the structures of scientific advice, as the scientific aspects of such issues were balanced or conflicted with other demands and values. To what extent, for example, was the freedom of the individual scientist to choose research projects balanced against the desire to secure more commercial applications? What was Thatcher’s stance towards European scientific collaboration and commitments? How did cuts in public expenditure affect the publicly funded research and teaching of universities? In weaving together numerous topics, including AIDS and bioethics, the nuclear industry and strategic defence, Agar adds to the picture we have of Thatcher and her radically Conservative agenda, and argues that the science policy devised under her leadership, not least in relation to industrial strategy, had a prolonged influence on the culture of British science.",304.0,['Science'],,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9bykDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=9bykDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Technology&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=344&source=gbs_api,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9bykDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9bykDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api

At the Intersection of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge and Technology Design,"['Nicola Bidwell', 'Heike Winschiers-Theophilus']","There is intensified interest in designing information and communication technologies (ICTs) that respond to ways of doing, knowing, and saying that differ from those that dominate in producing ICTs and, in particular, to ‘traditional’ or ‘indigenous’ knowledges. ICT endeavours for indigenous or traditional knowledges (ITK) vary. Some aim to extend ITK digitally and others use ICTs to improve the economic and/or political situation of marginalised groups.

Citizen Science,"['Susanne Hecker', 'Muki Haklay', 'Anne Bowser', 'Zen Makuch', 'Johannes Vogel', 'Aletta Bonn']","Citizen science, the active participation of the public in scientific research projects, is a rapidly expanding field in open science and open innovation. It provides an integrated model of public knowledge production and engagement with science. As a growing worldwide phenomenon, it is invigorated by evolving new technologies that connect people easily and effectively with the scientific community. Catalysed by citizens’ wishes to be actively involved in scientific processes, as a result of recent societal trends, it also offers contributions to the rise in tertiary education. In addition, citizen science provides a valuable tool for citizens to play a more active role in sustainable development. This book identifies and explains the role of citizen science within innovation in science and society, and as a vibrant and productive science-policy interface. The scope of this volume is global, geared towards identifying solutions and lessons to be applied across science, practice and policy.

Innovation and commercialization of emerging technologies.,Unknown,"Technological innovation is essential to the future well-being of the United States. The ability of the nation to sustain economic growth, increase its standard of living, and improve human health and the environment depends, in many ways, on its success in developing and commercializing new products, processes, and services. The growing capabilities of competitors in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere around the world increasingly challenge the ability of U.S. firms to convert the nation's science and technology base into a competitive advantage. Such concerns have prompted much debate about the proper role of government in encouraging innovation and the commercialization of new technologies. To date, however, the debate has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the ways in which firms develop and market new products, processes, and services and the barriers they must overcome in the process.",104.0,,4.5,2.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PM-w06fufMcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PM-w06fufMcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+Technology&hl=&as_brr=1&cd=397&source=gbs_api,,No link available

Energy Justice Across Borders,"['Gunter Bombaerts', 'Kirsten Jenkins', 'Yekeen A. Sanusi', 'Wang Guoyu']","This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. We must find new and innovative ways of conceptualizing transboundary energy issues, of embedding concerns of ethics or justice into energy policy, and of operationalizing response to them. This book stems from the emergent gap; the need for comparative approaches to energy justice, and for those that consider ethical traditions that go beyond the classical Western approach. This edited volume unites the fields of energy justice and comparative philosophy to provide an overarching global perspective and approach to applying energy ethics. We contribute to this purpose in four sections: setting the scene, practice, applying theory to practice, and theoretical approaches. Through the chapters featured in the volume, we position the book as one that contributes to energy justice scholarship across borders of nations, borders of ways of thinking and borders of disciplines.
